On the ocean\\'s wide expanse a hulk wallowed sluggishly,\\nthe forgotten relict of a once brave and sightly ship, possibly the\\nSphinx of some untold ocean tragedy, she lay black and forbidding in the\\nordered procession of waves. Half a mile to the east of the derelict\\nhovered a ship\\'s cutter, the turn of her crew\\'s heads speaking\\nexpectancy. As far again beyond, the United States cruiser\\n_Wolverine_ outlined her severe and trim silhouette against the\\nhorizon. In all the spread of wave and sky no other thing was visible.\\nFor this was one of the desert parts of the Pacific, three hundred miles\\nnorth of the steamship route from Yokohama to Honolulu, five hundred\\nmiles from the nearest land, Gardner Island, and more than seven hundred\\nnorthwest of the Hawaiian group.\\n\\nOn the cruiser\\'s quarter-deck the officers lined the starboard rail.\\nTheir interest was focussed on the derelict.\\n\\n\"Looks like a heavy job,\" said Ives, one of the junior lieutenants.\\n\"These floaters that lie with deck almost awash will stand more hammering\\nthan a mud fort.\"\\n\\n\"Wish they\\'d let us put some six-inch shells into her,\" said Billy\\nEdwards, the ensign, a wistful expression on his big round cheerful face.\\n\"I\\'d like to see what they would do.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing but waste a few hundred dollars of your Uncle Sam\\'s money,\"\\nobserved Carter, the officer of the deck. \"It takes placed charges inside\\nand out for that kind of work.\"\\n\\n\"Barnett\\'s the man for her then,\" said Ives. \"He\\'s no economist when it\\ncomes to getting results. There she goes!\"\\n\\nWithout any particular haste, as it seemed to the watchers, the hulk was\\nshouldered out of the water, as by some hidden leviathan. Its outlines\\nmelted into a black, outshowering mist, and from that mist leaped a\\ngiant. Up, up, he towered, tossed whirling arms a hundred feet abranch,\\nshivered, and dissolved into a widespread cataract. The water below was\\nlashed into fury, in the midst of which a mighty death agony beat back\\nthe troubled waves of the trade wind. Only then did the muffled double\\nboom of the explosion reach the ears of the spectators, presently to be\\nfollowed by a whispering, swift-skimming wavelet that swept irresistibly\\nacross the bigger surges and lapped the ship\\'s side, as for a message\\nthat the work was done.\\n\\nHere and there in the sea a glint of silver, a patch of purple, or dull\\nred, or a glistening apparition of black showed where the unintended\\nvictims of the explosion, the gay-hued open-sea fish of the warm waters,\\nhad succumbed to the force of the shock. Of the intended victim there was\\nno sign save a few fragments of wood bobbing in a swirl of water.\\n\\nWhen Barnett, the ordnance officer in charge of the destruction, returned\\nto the ship, Carter complimented him.\\n\\n\"Good clean job, Barnett. She was a tough customer, too.\"\\n\\n\"What was she?\" asked Ives.\\n\\n\"The _Caroline Lemp_, three-masted schooner. Anyone know about her?\"\\n\\nIves turned to the ship\\'s surgeon, Trendon, a grizzled and brief-spoken\\nveteran, who had at his finger\\'s tips all the lore of all the waters\\nunder the reign of the moon.\\n\\n\"What does the information bureau of the Seven Seas know about it?\"\\n\\n\"Lost three years ago--spring of 1901--got into ice field off the tip of\\nthe Aleutians. Some of the crew froze. Others got ashore. Part of\\nsurvivors accounted for. Others not. Say they\\'ve turned native. Don\\'t\\nknow myself.\"\\n\\n\"The Aleutians!\" exclaimed Billy Edwards. \"Great Cats! What a drift! How\\nmany thousand miles would that be?\"\\n\\n\"Not as far as many another derelict has wandered in her time, son,\" said\\nBarnett.\\n\\nThe talk washed back and forth across the hulks of classic sea mysteries,\\nnew and old; of the _City of Boston_, which went down with all\\nhands, leaving for record only a melancholy scrawl on a bit of board to\\nmeet the wondering eyes of a fisherman on the far Cornish coast; of the\\n_Great Queensland_, which set out with five hundred and sixty-nine\\nsouls aboard, bound by a route unknown to a tragic end; of the\\n_Naronic_, with her silent and empty lifeboats alone left, drifting\\nabout the open sea, to hint at the story of her fate; of the\\n_Huronian_, which, ten years later, on the same day and date, and\\nhailing from the same port as the _Naronic_, went out into the void,\\nleaving no trace; of Newfoundland captains who sailed, roaring with\\ndrink, under the arches of cathedral bergs, only to be prisoned, buried,\\nand embalmed in the one icy embrace; of craft assailed by the terrible\\none-stroke lightning clouds of the Indian Ocean, found days after, stone\\nblind, with their crews madly hauling at useless sheets, while the\\nofficers clawed the compass and shrieked; of burnings and piracies; of\\npest ships and slave ships, and ships mad for want of water; of whelming\\nearthquake waves, and mysterious suctions, drawing irresistibly against\\nwind and steam power upon unknown currents; of stout hulks deserted in\\npanic although sound and seaworthy; and of others so swiftly dragged down\\nthat there was no time for any to save himself; and of a hundred other\\nstrange, stirring and pitiful ventures such as make up the inevitable\\nperil and incorrigible romance of the ocean. In a pause Billy Edwards\\nsaid musingly:\\n\\n\"Well, there was the _Laughing Lass_.\"\\n\\n\"How did you happen to hit on her?\" asked Barnett quickly.\\n\\n\"Why not, sir? It naturally came into my head. She was last seen\\nsomewhere about this part of the world, wasn\\'t she?\" After a moment\\'s\\nhesitation he added: \"From something I heard ashore I judge we\\'ve a\\ncommission to keep a watch out for her as well as to destroy derelicts.\"\\n\\n\"What about the _Laughing Lass_?\" asked McGuire, the paymaster, a\\nNew Englander, who had been in the service but a short time.\\n\\n\"Good Lord! don\\'t you remember the _Laughing Lass_ mystery and the\\ndisappearance of Doctor Schermerhorn?\"\\n\\n\"Karl Augustus Schermerhorn, the man whose experiments to identify\\ntelepathy with the Marconi wireless waves made such a furore in the\\npapers?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that was only a by-product of his mind. He was an original\\ninvestigator in every line of physics and chemistry, besides most of the\\nnatural sciences,\" said Barnett. \"The government is particularly\\ninterested in him because of his contributions to aërial photography.\"\\n\\n\"And he was lost with the _Laughing Lass_?\"\\n\\n\"Nobody knows,\" said Edwards. \"He left San Francisco two years ago on a\\nhundred-foot schooner, with an assistant, a big brass-bound chest, and a\\nragamuffin crew. A newspaper man named Slade, who dropped out of the\\nworld about the same time, is supposed to have gone along, too. Their\\nschooner was last sighted about 450 miles northeast of Oahu, in good\\nshape, and bound westward. That\\'s all the record of her that there is.\"\\n\\n\"Was that Ralph Slade?\" asked Barnett.\\n\\n\"Yes. He was a free-lance writer and artist.\"\\n\\n\"I knew him well,\" said Barnett. \"He was in our mess in the Philippine\\ncampaign, on the _North Dakota_. War correspondent then. It\\'s\\nstrange that I never identified him before with the Slade of the\\n_Laughing Lass_.\"\\n\\n\"What was the object of the voyage?\" asked Ives.\\n\\n\"They were supposed to be after buried treasure,\" said Barnett.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always thought it more likely that Doctor Schermerhorn was on a\\nscientific expedition,\" said Edwards. \"I knew the old boy, and he wasn\\'t\\nthe sort to care a hoot in Sheol for treasure, buried or unburied.\"\\n\\n\"Every time a ship sets out from San Francisco without publishing to all\\nthe world just what her business is, all the world thinks it\\'s one of\\nthose wild-goose hunts,\" observed Ives.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" agreed Barnett. \"Flora and fauna of some unknown island would be\\nmuch more in the Schermerhorn line of traffic. Not unlikely that some of\\nthe festive natives collected the unfortunate professor.\"\\n\\nVarious theories were advanced, withdrawn, refuted, defended, and the\\ndiscussion carried them through the swift twilight into the darkness\\nwhich had been hastened by a high-spreading canopy of storm-clouds.\\nAbruptly from the crow\\'s-nest came startling news for those desolate\\nseas: \"Light--ho! Two points on the port bow.\"\\n\\nThe lookout had given extra voice to it. It was plainly heard throughout\\nthe ship.\\n\\nThe group of officers stared in the direction indicated, but could see\\nnothing. Presently Ives and Edwards, who were the keenest-sighted, made\\nout a faint, suffused radiance. At the same time came a second hail from\\nthe crow\\'s-nest.\\n\\n\"On deck, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Hello,\" responded Carter, the officer of the deck.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a light here I can\\'t make anything out of, sir.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s it like?\"\\n\\n\"Sort of a queer general glow.\"\\n\\n\"General glow, indeed!\" muttered Forsythe, among the group aft. \"That\\nfellow\\'s got an imagination.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you describe it better than that?\" called Carter.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make it out at all, sir. \\'Tain\\'t any regular and proper light.\\nLooks like a lamp in a fog.\"\\n\\nAmong themselves the officers discussed it interestedly, as it grew\\nplainer.\\n\\n\"Not unlike the electric glow above a city, seen from a distance,\" said\\nBarnett, as it grew plainer.\\n\\n\"Yes: but the nearest electric-lighted city is some eight hundred miles\\naway,\" objected Ives.\\n\\n\"Mirage, maybe,\" suggested Edwards.\\n\\n\"Pretty hard-working mirage, to cover that distance\" said Ives. \"Though\\nI\\'ve seen \\'em----\"\\n\\n\"Great heavens! Look at that!\" shouted Edwards.\\n\\nA great shaft of pale brilliance shot up toward the zenith. Under it\\nwhirled a maelstrom of varied radiance, pale with distance, but\\nmarvellously beautiful. Forsythe passed them with a troubled face, on his\\nway below to report, as his relief went up.\\n\\n\"The quartermaster reports the compass behaving queerly,\" he said.\\n\\nThree minutes later the captain was on the bridge. The great ship had\\nswung, and they were speeding direct for the phenomenon. But within a few\\nminutes the light had died out.\\n\\n\"Another sea mystery to add to our list,\" said Billy Edwards. \"Did anyone\\never see a show like that before? What do you think, Doc?\"\\n\\n\"Humph!\" grunted the veteran. \"New to me. Volcanic, maybe.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nTHE _LAUGHING LASS_\\n\\n\\nThe falling of dusk on June the 3d found tired eyes aboard the\\n_Wolverine_. Every officer in her complement had kept a private and\\npersonal lookout all day for some explanation of the previous night\\'s\\nphenomenon. All that rewarded them were a sky filmed with lofty clouds,\\nand the holiday parade of the epauletted waves.\\n\\nNor did evening bring a repetition of that strange glow. Midnight found\\nthe late stayers still deep in the discussion.\\n\\n\"One thing is certain,\" said Ives. \"It wasn\\'t volcanic.\"\\n\\n\"Why so?\" asked the paymaster.\\n\\n\"Because volcanoes are mostly stationary, and we headed due for that\\nlight.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but did we keep headed?\" said Barnett, who was navigating officer\\nas well as ordnance officer, in a queer voice.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" asked Edwards eagerly.\\n\\n\"After the light disappeared the compass kept on varying. The stars were\\nhidden. There is no telling just where we were headed for some time.\"\\n\\n\"Then we might be fifty miles from the spot we aimed at.\"\\n\\n\"Hardly that,\" said the navigator. \"We could guide her to some extent by\\nthe direction of wind and waves. If it was volcanic we ought certainly to\\nhave sighted it by now.\"\\n\\n\"Always some electricity in volcanic eruptions,\" said Trendon. \"Makes\\ncompass cut didoes. Seen it before.\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" queried Carter.\\n\\n\"Off Martinique. Pelée eruption. Needle chased its tail like a kitten.\"\\n\\n\"Are there many volcanoes hereabouts?\" somebody asked.\\n\\n\"We\\'re in 162 west, 31 north, about,\" said Barnett. \"No telling whether\\nthere are or not. There weren\\'t at last accounts, but that\\'s no evidence\\nthat there aren\\'t some since. They come up in the night, these volcanic\\nislands.\"\\n\\n\"Just cast an eye on the charts,\" said Billy Edwards. \"Full of E. D.\\'s\\nand P. D.\\'s all over the shop. Every one of \\'em volcanic.\"\\n\\n\"E. D.\\'s and P. D.\\'s?\" queried the paymaster.\\n\\n\"Existence doubtful, and position doubtful,\" explained the ensign. \"Every\\ntime the skipper of one of these wandering trade ships gets a speck in\\nhis eye, he reports an island. If he really does bump into a rock he cuts\\nin an arithmetic book for his latitude and longitude and lets it go at\\nthat. That\\'s how the chart makers make a living, getting out new editions\\nevery few months.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s a fact that these seas are constantly changing,\" said Barnett.\\n\"They\\'re so little travelled that no one happens to be around to see an\\nisland born. I don\\'t suppose there\\'s a part on the earth\\'s surface more\\nliable to seismic disturbances than this region.\"\\n\\n\"Seismic!\" cried Billy Edwards, \"I should say it was seismic! Why, when a\\nnative of one of these island groups sets his heart on a particular loaf\\nof bread up his bread-fruit tree, he doesn\\'t bother to climb after it.\\nJust waits for some earthquake to happen along and shake it down to him.\"\\n\\n\"Good boy, Billy,\" said Dr. Trendon, approvingly. \"Do another.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fact,\" said the ensign, heatedly. \"Why, a couple of years back\\nthere was a trader here stocked up with a lot of belly-mixture in\\nbottles. Thought he was going to make his pile because there\\'d been a\\ncolic epidemic in the islands the season before. Bottles were labelled\\n\\'Do not shake.\\' That settled his business. Might as well have marked \\'em\\n\\'Keep frozen\\' in this part of the world. Fellow went broke.\"\\n\\n\"In any case,\" said Barnett, \"such a glow as that we sighted last night\\nI\\'ve never seen from any volcano.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" said Trendon. \"Don\\'t prove it mightn\\'t have been.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just bet the best dinner in San Francisco that it isn\\'t,\" said\\nEdwards.\\n\\n\"You\\'re on,\" said Carter.\\n\\n\"Let me in,\" suggested Ives.\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll take one of it,\" said McGuire.\\n\\n\"Come one, come all,\" said Edwards cheerily. \"I\\'ll live high on the\\ncollective bad judgment of this outfit.\"\\n\\n\"To-night isn\\'t likely to settle it, anyhow,\" said Ives. \"I move we turn\\nin.\"\\n\\nExpectant minds do not lend themselves to sound slumber. All night the\\nofficers of the _Wolverine_ slept on the verge of waking, but it was\\nnot until dawn that the cry of \"Sail-ho!\" sent them all hurrying to their\\nclothes. Ordinarily officers of the U.S. Navy do not scuttle on deck like\\na crowd of curious schoolgirls, but all hands had been keyed to a high\\npitch over the elusive light, and the bet with Edwards now served as an\\nexcuse for the betrayal of unusual eagerness. Hence the quarter-deck was\\nsoon alive with men who were wont to be deep in dreams at that hour.\\n\\nThey found Carter, whose watch on deck it was, reprimanding the lookout.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" the man was insisting, \"she didn\\'t show no light, sir. I\\'d \\'a\\'\\nsighted her an hour ago, sir, if she had.\"\\n\\n\"We shall see,\" said Carter grimly. \"Who\\'s your relief?\"\\n\\n\"Sennett.\"\\n\\n\"Let him take your place. Go aloft, Sennett.\"\\n\\nAs the lookout, crestfallen and surly, went below, Barnett said in\\nsubdued tones:\\n\\n\"Upon my word, I shouldn\\'t be surprised if the man were right. Certainly\\nthere\\'s something queer about that hooker. Look how she handles herself.\"\\n\\nThe vessel was some three miles to windward. She was a schooner of the\\ncommon two-masted Pacific type, but she was comporting herself in a\\nmanner uncommon on the Pacific, or any other ocean. Even as Barnett\\nspoke, she heeled well over, and came rushing up into the wind, where she\\nstood with all sails shaking. Slowly she paid off again, bearing away\\nfrom them. Now she gathered full headway, yet edged little by little to\\nwindward again.\\n\\n\"Mighty queer tactics,\" muttered Edwards. \"I think she\\'s steering\\nherself.\"\\n\\n\"Good thing she carries a weather helm,\" commented Ives, who was an\\nexpert on sailing rigs. \"Most of that type do. Otherwise she\\'d have jibed\\nher masts out, running loose that way.\"\\n\\nCaptain Parkinson appeared on deck and turned his glasses for a full\\nminute on the strange schooner.\\n\\n\"Aloft there,\" he hailed the crow\\'s-nest. \"Do you make out anyone\\naboard?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" came the answer.\\n\\n\"Mr. Carter, have the chief quartermaster report on deck with the signal\\nflags.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t we going to run up to her?\" asked McGuire, turning in surprise to\\nEdwards.\\n\\n\"And take the risk of getting a hole punched in our pretty paint, with\\nher running amuck that way? Not much!\"\\n\\nUp came the signal quartermaster to get his orders, and there ensued a\\none-sided conversation in the pregnant language of the sea.\\n\\n\"What ship is that?\"\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n\"Are you in trouble?\" asked the cruiser, and waited. The schooner showed\\na bare and silent main-peak.\\n\\n\"Heave to.\" Now Uncle Sam was giving orders.\\n\\nBut the other paid no heed.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll make that a little more emphatic,\" said Captain Parkinson. A\\nmoment later there was the sharp crash of a gun and a shot went across\\nthe bows of the sailing vessel. Hastened by a flaw of wind that veered\\nfrom the normal direction of the breeze the stranger made sharply to\\nwindward, as if to obey.\\n\\n\"Ah, there she comes,\" ran the comment along the cruiser\\'s quarter-deck.\\n\\nBut the schooner, after standing for a moment, all flapping, answered\\nanother flaw, and went wide about on the opposite tack.\\n\\n\"Derelict,\" remarked Captain Parkinson. \"She seems to be in good shape,\\ntoo, Dr. Trendon!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\" The surgeon went to the captain, and the others could hear\\nhis deep, abrupt utterance in reply to some question too low for their\\nears.\\n\\n\"Might be, sir. Beri-beri, maybe. More likely smallpox if anything of\\nthat kind. But _some_ of \\'em would be on deck.\"\\n\\n\"Whew! A plague ship!\" said Billy Edwards. \"Just my luck to be ordered to\\nboard her.\" He shivered slightly.\\n\\n\"Scared, Billy?\" said Ives. Edwards had a record for daring which made\\nthis joke obvious enough to be safe.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t want to have my peculiar style of beauty spoiled by smallpox\\nmarks,\" said the ensign, with a smile on his homely, winning face. \"And\\nI\\'ve a hunch that that ship is not a lucky find for this ship.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ve a hunch that your hunch is a wrong one,\" said Ives. \"How long\\nwould you guess that craft to be?\"\\n\\n[Illustration: A schooner comporting herself in a manner uncommon on the\\nPacific]\\n\\nThey were now within a mile of the schooner. Edwards scrutinised her\\ncalculatingly.\\n\\n\"Eighty to ninety feet.\"\\n\\n\"Say 150 tons. And she\\'s a two-masted schooner, isn\\'t she?\" continued\\nIves, insinuatingly.\\n\\n\"She certainly is.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve a hunch that that ship is a lucky find for any ship, but\\nparticularly for this ship.\"\\n\\n\"Great Caesar!\" cried the ensign excitedly. \"Do you think it\\'s\\n_her_?\"\\n\\nA buzz of electric interest went around the group. Every glass was\\nraised; every eye strained toward her stern to read the name as she\\nveered into the wind again. About she came. A sharp sigh of excited\\ndisappointment exhaled from the spectators. The name had been painted\\nout.\\n\\n\"No go,\" breathed Edwards. \"But I\\'ll bet another dinner----\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Edwards,\" called the captain. \"You will take the second cutter,\\nboard that schooner, and make a full investigation.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Take your time. Don\\'t come alongside until she is in the wind. Leave\\nenough men aboard to handle her.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\nThe cruiser steamed to within half a mile of the aimless traveller, and\\nthe small boat put out. Not one of his fellows but envied the young\\nensign as he left the ship, steered by Timmins, a veteran bo\\'s\\'n\\'s mate,\\nwise in all the ins and outs of sea ways. They saw him board, neatly\\nrunning the small boat under the schooner\\'s counter; they saw the\\nforesheet eased off and the ship run up into the wind; then the foresail\\ndropped and the wheel lashed so that she would stand so. They awaited the\\nreappearance of Edwards and the bo\\'s\\'n\\'s mate when they had vanished\\nbelow decks, and with an intensity of eagerness they followed the return\\nof the small boat.\\n\\nBilly Edwards\\'s face as he came on deck was a study. It was alight with\\nexcitement; yet between the eyes two deep wrinkles of puzzlement\\nquivered. Such a face the mathematician bends above his paper when some\\nobstructive factor arises between him and his solution.\\n\\n\"Well, sir?\" There was a hint of effort at restraint in the captain\\'s\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"She\\'s the _Laughing Lass_, sir. Everything ship-shape, but not a\\nsoul aboard.\"\\n\\n\"Come below, Mr. Edwards,\" said the captain. And they went, leaving\\nbehind them a boiling cauldron of theory and conjecture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nTHE DEATH SHIP\\n\\n\\nBilly Edwards came on deck with a line of irritation right-angling the\\nfurrows between his eyes.\\n\\n\"Go ahead,\" the quarter-deck bade him, seeing him aflush with\\ninformation.\\n\\n\"The captain won\\'t believe me,\" blurted out Edwards.\\n\\n\"Is it as bad as that?\" asked Barnett, smiling.\\n\\n\"It certainly is,\" replied the younger man seriously. \"I don\\'t know that\\nI blame him. I\\'d hardly believe it myself if I hadn\\'t----\"\\n\\n\"Oh, go on. Out with it. Give us the facts. Never mind your credibility.\"\\n\\n\"The facts are that there lies the _Laughing Lass_, a little\\nweather-worn, but sound as a dollar, and not a living being aboard of\\nher. Her boats are all there. Everything\\'s in good condition, though none\\ntoo orderly. Pitcher half full of fresh water in the rack. Sails all O.\\nK. Ashes of the galley fire still warm. I tell you, gentlemen, that ship\\nhasn\\'t been deserted more than a couple of days at the outside.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure all the boats are there?\" asked Ives.\\n\\n\"Dory, dingy, and two surf boats. Isn\\'t that enough?\"\\n\\n\"Plenty.\"\\n\\n\"Been over her, inside and out. No sign of collision. No leak. No\\nanything, except that the starboard side is blistered a bit. No evidence\\nof fire anywhere else. I tell you,\" said Billy Edwards pathetically,\\n\"it\\'s given me a headache.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s one of those cases of panic that Forsythe spoke of the\\nother night,\" said Ives. \"The crew got frightened at something and ran\\naway, with the devil after them.\"\\n\\n\"But crews don\\'t just step out and run around the corner and hide, when\\nthey\\'re scared,\" objected Barnett.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, too,\" assented Ives. \"Well, perhaps that volcanic eruption\\njarred them so that they jumped for it.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty wild theory, that,\" said Edwards.\\n\\n\"No wilder than the facts, as you give them,\" was the retort.\\n\\n\"That\\'s so,\" admitted the ensign gloomily.\\n\\n\"But how about pestilence?\" suggested Barnett.\\n\\n\"Maybe they died fast and the last survivor, after the bodies of the rest\\nwere overboard, got delirious and jumped after them.\"\\n\\n\"Not if the galley fire was hot,\" said Dr. Trendon, briefly. \"No;\\npestilence doesn\\'t work that way.\"\\n\\n\"Did you look at the wheel, Billy?\" asked Ives.\\n\\n\"Did I! There\\'s another thing. Wheel\\'s all right, but compass is no good\\nat all. It\\'s regularly bewitched.\"\\n\\n\"What about the log, then?\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t find it anywhere. Hunted high, low, jack, and the game;\\neverywhere except in the big, brass-bound chest I found in the captain\\'s\\ncabin. Couldn\\'t break into that.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Schermerhorn\\'s chest!\" exclaimed Barnett. \"Then he was aboard.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he isn\\'t aboard now,\" said the ensign grimly. \"Not in the flesh.\\nAnd that\\'s all,\" he added suddenly.\\n\\n\"No; it isn\\'t all,\" said Barnett gently. \"There\\'s something else.\\nCaptain\\'s orders?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no. Captain Parkinson doesn\\'t take enough stock in my report to tell\\nme to withhold anything,\" said Edwards, with a trace of bitterness in his\\nvoice. \"It\\'s nothing that I believe myself, anyhow.\"\\n\\n\"Give _us_ a chance to believe it,\" said Ives.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the ensign hesitantly, \"there\\'s a sort of atmosphere about\\nthat schooner that\\'s almost uncanny.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you had the shudders before you were ordered to board,\" bantered\\nIves.\\n\\n\"I know it. I\\'d have thought it was one of those fool presentiments if I\\nwere the only one to feel it. But the men were affected, too. They kept\\ntogether like frightened sheep. And I heard one say to another: \\'Hey,\\nBoney, d\\'you feel like someone was a-buzzin\\' your nerves like a\\nfiddle-string?\\' Now,\" demanded Edwards plaintively, \"what right has a\\njackie to have nerves?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s strange enough about the compass,\" said Barnett slowly. \"Ours is\\nall right again. The schooner must have been so near the electric\\ndisturbance that her instruments were permanently deranged.\"\\n\\n\"That would lend weight to the volcanic theory,\" said Carter.\\n\\n\"So the captain didn\\'t take kindly to your go-look-see?\" questioned Ives\\nof Edwards.\\n\\n\"As good as told me I\\'d missed the point of the thing,\" said the ensign,\\nflushing. \"Perhaps he can make more of it himself. At any rate, he\\'s\\ngoing to try. Here he is now.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Trendon,\" said the captain, appearing. \"You will please to go with\\nme to the schooner.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the surgeon, rising from his chair with such alacrity as\\nto draw from Ives the sardonic comment:\\n\\n\"Why, I actually believe old Trendon is excited.\"\\n\\nFor two hours after the departure of the captain and Trendon there were\\ndull times on the quarter-deck of the _Wolverine_. Then the surgeon\\ncame back to them.\\n\\n\"Billy was right,\" he said.\\n\\n\"But he didn\\'t tell us anything,\" cried Ives. \"He didn\\'t clear up the\\nmystery.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what,\" said Trendon. \"One thing Billy said,\" he added, waxing\\nunusually prolix for him, \"was truer than maybe he knew.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" murmured the ensign. \"What was that?\"\\n\\n\"You said \\'Not a living being aboard.\\' Exact words, hey?\"\\n\\n\"Well, what of it?\" exclaimed the ensign excitedly. \"You don\\'t mean you\\nfound dead----?\"\\n\\n\"Keep your temperature down, my boy. No. You were exactly right. Not a\\nliving being aboard.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks for nothing,\" retorted the ensign.\\n\\n\"Neither human nor other,\" pursued Trendon.\\n\\n\"What!\"\\n\\n\"Food scattered around the galley. Crumbs on the mess table. Ever see a\\nwooden ship without cockroaches?\"\\n\\n\"Never particularly investigated the matter.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t believe such a thing exists,\" said Ives.\\n\\n\"Not a cockroach on the _Laughing Lass_. Ever know of an old hooker\\nthat wasn\\'t overrun with rats?\"\\n\\n\"No; nor anyone else. Not above water.\"\\n\\n\"Found a dozen dead rats. No sound or sign of a live one on the\\n_Laughing Lass_. No rats, no mice. No bugs. Gentlemen, the\\n_Laughing Lass_ is a charnel ship.\"\\n\\n\"No wonder Billy\\'s tender nerves went wrong.\" said Ives, with\\nirrepressible flippancy. \"She\\'s probably haunted by cockroach wraiths.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll have a chance to see,\" said Trendon. \"Captain\\'s going to put him\\nin charge.\"\\n\\n\"By way of apology, then,\" said Barnett. \"That\\'s pretty square.\"\\n\\n\"Captain Parkinson wishes to see you in his cabin, Mr. Edwards,\" said an\\norderly, coming in.\\n\\n\"A pleasant voyage, Captain Billy,\" said Ives. \"Sing out if the goblins\\ngit yer.\"\\n\\nFifteen minutes later Ensign Edwards, with a quartermaster, Timmins, the\\nbo\\'s\\'n\\'s mate, and a crew, was heading a straight course toward his first\\ncommand, with instructions to \"keep company and watch for signals\"; and\\nintention to break into the brass-bound chest and ferret out what clue\\nlay there, if it took dynamite. As he boarded, Barnett and Trendon, with\\nboth of whom the lad was a favourite, came to a sinister conclusion.\\n\\n\"It\\'s poison, I suppose,\" said the first officer.\\n\\n\"And a mighty subtle sort,\" agreed Trendon. \"Don\\'t like the looks of it.\"\\nHe shook a solemn head. \"Don\\'t like it for a damn.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nTHE SECOND PRIZE CREW\\n\\n\\nIn semi-tropic Pacific weather the unexpected so seldom happens as to be\\na negligible quantity. The _Wolverine_ met with it on June 5th. From\\nsome unaccountable source in that realm of the heaven-scouring trades\\ncame a heavy mist. Possibly volcanic action, deranging by its electric\\nand gaseous outpourings the normal course of the winds, had given birth\\nto it. Be that as it may, it swept down upon the cruiser, thickening as\\nit approached, until presently it had spread a curtain between the\\nwarship and its charge. The wind died. Until after fall of night the\\n_Wolverine_ moved slowly, bellowing for the schooner, but got no\\nreply. Once they thought they heard a distant shout of response, but\\nthere was no repetition.\\n\\n\"Probably doesn\\'t carry any fog horn,\" said Carter bitterly, voicing a\\ngeneral uneasiness.\\n\\n\"No log; compass crazy; without fog signal; I don\\'t like that craft.\\nBarnett ought to have been ordered to blow the damned thing up, as a\\nperil to the high seas.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll pick her up in the morning, surely,\" said Forsythe. \"This can\\'t\\nlast for ever.\"\\n\\nNor did it last long. An hour before midnight a pounding shower fell,\\nlashing the sea into phosphorescent whiteness. It ceased, and with the\\ngrowl of a leaping animal a squall furiously beset the ship. Soon the\\ngreat steel body was plunging and heaving in the billows. It was a gloomy\\ncompany about the wardroom table. Upon each and all hung an oppression of\\nspirit. Captain Parkinson came from his cabin and went on deck.\\nConstitutionally he was a nervous and pessimistic man with a fixed belief\\nin the conspiracy of events, banded for the undoing of him and his. Blind\\nor dubious conditions racked his soul, but real danger found him not only\\nprepared, but even eager. Now his face was a picture of foreboding.\\n\\n\"Parky looks as if Davy Jones was pulling on his string,\" observed the\\nflippant Ives to his neighbour.\\n\\n\"Worrying about the schooner. Hope Billy Edwards saw or heard or felt\\nthat squall coming,\" replied Forsythe, giving expression to the anxiety\\nthat all felt.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a good sailor man,\" said Ives, \"and that\\'s a staunch little\\nschooner, by the way she handled herself.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it will be all right,\" said Carter confidently. \"The wind\\'s\\nmoderating now.\"\\n\\n\"But there\\'s no telling how far out of the course this may have blown\\nhim.\"\\n\\nBarnett came down, dripping.\\n\\n\"Anything new?\" asked Dr. Trendon.\\n\\nThe navigating officer shook his head.\\n\\n\"Nothing. But the captain\\'s in a state of mind,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with him?\"\\n\\n\"The schooner. Seems possessed with the notion that there\\'s something\\nwrong with her.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you feeling a little that way yourself?\" said Forsythe. \"I am.\\nI\\'ll take a look around before I turn in.\"\\n\\nHe left behind him a silent crowd. His return was prompt and swift.\\n\\n\"Come on deck,\" he said.\\n\\nEvery man leaped as to an order. There was that in Forsythe\\'s voice which\\nstung. The weather had cleared somewhat, though scudding wrack still blew\\nacross them to the westward. The ship rolled heavily. Of the sea naught\\nwas visible except the arching waves, but in the sky they beheld again,\\nwith a sickening sense of disaster, that pale and lovely glow which had\\nso bewildered them two nights before.\\n\\n\"The aurora!\" cried McGuire, the paymaster.\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly,\" replied Ives, with sarcasm. \"Dead in the west. Common\\nspot for the aurora. Particularly on the edge of the South Seas, where\\nthey are thick!\"\\n\\n\"Then what is it?\"\\n\\nNobody had an answer. Carter hastened forward and returned to report.\\n\\n\"It\\'s electrical anyway,\" said Carter. \"The compass is queer again.\"\\n\\n\"Edwards ought to be close to the solution of it,\" ventured Ives. \"This\\ngale should have blown him just about to the centre of interest.\"\\n\\n\"If only he isn\\'t involved in it,\" said Carter anxiously.\\n\\n\"What could there be to involve him?\" asked McGuire.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Carter slowly. \"Somehow I feel as if the desertion\\nof the schooner was in some formidable manner connected with that light.\"\\n\\nFor perhaps fifteen minutes the glow continued. It seemed to be nearer at\\nhand than on the former sighting; but it took no comprehensible form.\\nThen it died away and all was blackness again. But the officers of the\\n_Wolverine_ had long been in troubled slumber before the sensitive\\ncompass regained its exact balance, and with the shifting wind to mislead\\nher, the cruiser had wandered, by morning, no man might know how far from\\nher course.\\n\\nAll day long of June 6th the _Wolverine_, baffled by patches of mist\\nand moving rain-squalls, patrolled the empty seas without sighting the\\nlost schooner. The evening brought an envelope of fog again, and\\npresently a light breeze came up from the north. An hour of it had failed\\nto disperse the mist, when there was borne down to the warship a flapping\\nsound as of great wings. The flapping grew louder--waned--ceased--and\\nfrom the lookout came a hail.\\n\\n\"Ship\\'s lights three points on the starboard quarter.\"\\n\\n\"What do you make it out to be?\" came the query from below.\\n\\n\"Green light\\'s all I can see, sir.\" There was a pause.\\n\\n\"There\\'s her port light, now. Looks to be turning and bearing down on us,\\nsir. Coming dead for us\"--the man\\'s voice rose--\"close aboard; less\\'n two\\nship\\'s lengths away!\"\\n\\nAs for a prearranged scene, the fog-curtain parted. There loomed silently\\nand swiftly the _Laughing Lass_. Down she bore upon the greater\\nvessel until it seemed as if she must ram; but all the time she was\\nveering to windward, and now she ran into the wind with a castanet rattle\\nof sails. So close aboard was she that the eager eyes of Uncle Sam\\'s men\\npeered down upon her empty decks--for she was void of life.\\n\\nBehind the cruiser\\'s blanketing she paid off very slowly, but presently\\ncaught the breeze full and again whitened the water at her prow.\\nForgetting regulations, Ives hailed loudly:\\n\\n\"Ahoy, _Laughing Lass_! Ahoy, Billy Edwards!\"\\n\\nNo sound, no animate motion came from aboard that apparition, as she fell\\nastern. A shudder of horror ran across the _Wolverine_\\'s\\nquarter-deck. A wraith ship, peopled with skeletons, would have been less\\ndreadful to their sight than the brisk and active desolation of the\\nheeling schooner.\\n\\n\"Been deserted since early last night,\" said Trendon hoarsely.\\n\\n\"How can you tell that?\" asked Barnett.\\n\\n\"Both sails reefed down. Ready for that squall. Been no weather since to\\ncall for reefs. Must have quit her during the squall.\"\\n\\n\"Then they jumped,\" cried Carter, \"for I saw her boats. It isn\\'t\\nbelievable.\"\\n\\n\"Neither was the other,\" said Trendon grimly.\\n\\nA hurried succession of orders stopped further discussion for the time.\\nIves was sent aboard the schooner to lower sail and report. He came back\\nwith a staggering dearth of information. The boats were all there; the\\nship was intact--as intact as when Billy Edwards had taken charge--but\\nthe cheery, lovable ensign and his men had vanished without trace or\\nclue. As to the how or the wherefore they might rack their brains without\\nguessing. There was the beginning of a log in the ensign\\'s handwriting,\\nwhich Ives had found with high excitement and read with bitter\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n\"Had squall from northeast,\" it ran. \"Double reefed her and she took it\\nnicely. Seems a seaworthy, quick ship. Further search for log. No result.\\nHave ordered one of crew who is a bit of a mechanic to work at the\\nbrass-bound chest till he gets it open. He reports marks on the lock as\\nif somebody had been trying to pick it before him.\"\\n\\nThere was no further entry.\\n\\n\"Dr. Trendon is right,\" said Barnett. \"Whatever happened--and God only\\nknows what it could have been--it happened just after the squall.\"\\n\\n\"Just about the time of the strange glow,\" cried Ives.\\n\\nIt was decided that two men and a petty officer should be sent aboard the\\n_Laughing Lass_ to make her fast with a cable, and remain on board\\nover night. But when the order was given the men hung back. One of them\\nprotested brokenly that he was sick. Trendon, after examination, reported\\nto the captain.\\n\\n\"Case of blue funk, sir. Might as well be sick. Good for nothing. Others\\naren\\'t much better.\"\\n\\n\"Who was to be in charge?\"\\n\\n\"Congdon,\" replied the doctor, naming one of the petty officers.\\n\\n\"He\\'s my coxswain,\" said Captain Parkinson. \"A first-class man. I can\\nhardly believe that he is afraid. We\\'ll see.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: A man who was a bit of a mechanic was set to work to open\\nthe chest]\\n\\nCongdon was sent for.\\n\\n\"You\\'re ordered aboard the schooner for the night, Congdon,\" said the\\ncaptain.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Is there any reason why you do not wish to go?\"\\n\\nThe man hesitated, looking miserable. Finally he blurted out, not without\\na certain dignity:\\n\\n\"I obey orders, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Speak out, my man,\" urged the captain kindly.\\n\\n\"Well, sir: it\\'s Mr. Edwards, then. You couldn\\'t scare him off a ship,\\nsir, unless it was something--something----\"\\n\\nHe stopped, failing of the word.\\n\\n\"You know what Mr. Edwards was, sir, for pluck,\" he concluded.\\n\\n\"_Was_!\" cried the captain sharply. \"What do you mean?\\n\\n\"The schooner got him, sir. You don\\'t make no doubt of that, do you,\\nsir?\" The man spoke in a hushed voice, with a shrinking glance back of\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Will you go aboard under Mr. Ives?\"\\n\\n\"Anywhere my officer goes I\\'ll go, and gladly, sir.\"\\n\\nIves was sent aboard in charge. For that night, in a light breeze, the\\ntwo ships lay close together, the schooner riding jauntily astern. But\\nnot until morning illumined the world of waters did the\\n_Wolverine_\\'s people feel confident that the _Laughing Lass_\\nwould not vanish away from their ken like a shape of the mist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE\\n\\n\\nWhen Barnett come on deck very early in the morning of June 7th, he found\\nDr. Trendon already up and staring moodily out at the _Laughing\\nLass_. As the night was calm the tow had made fair time toward their\\nport in the Hawaiian group. The surgeon was muttering something which\\nseemed to Barnett to be in a foreign tongue.\\n\\n\"Thought out any clue, doctor?\" asked the first officer.\\n\\n\"_Petit Chel_--Pshaw! _Jolie Celimene!_ No,\" muttered Trendon.\\n\"_Marie--Marie_--I\\'ve got it! The _Marie Celeste_.\"\\n\\n\"Got what? What about her?\"\\n\\n\"Parallel case,\" said Trendon. \"Sailed from New York back in the\\nseventies. Seven weeks out was found derelict. Everything in perfect\\norder. Captain\\'s wife\\'s hem on the machine. Boats all accounted for. No\\nsign of struggle. Log written to within forty-eight hours.\"\\n\\n\"What became of the crew?\"\\n\\n\"Wish I could tell you. Might help to unravel our tangle.\" He shook his\\nhead in sudden, unwonted passion.\\n\\n\"Evidently there\\'s something criminal in her record,\" said Barnett,\\nfrowning at the fusty schooner astern. \"Otherwise the name wouldn\\'t be\\npainted out.\"\\n\\n\"Painted out long ago. See how rusty it is. Schermerhorn\\'s work maybe,\"\\nreplied Trendon. \"Secret expedition, remember.\"\\n\\n\"In the name of wonders, why should he do it?\"\\n\\n\"Secret expedition, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Um-ah; that\\'s true,\" said the other thoughtfully. \"It\\'s quite possible.\"\\n\\n\"Captain wishes to see both of you gentlemen in the ward room, if you\\nplease,\" came a message.\\n\\nBelow they found all the officers gathered. Captain Parkinson was pacing\\nup and down in ill-controlled agitation.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we are facing a problem which, so far as I know,\\nis without parallel. It is my intention to bring the schooner which we\\nhave in tow to port at Honolulu. In the present unsettled weather we\\ncannot continue to tow her. I wish two officers to take charge. Under the\\ncircumstances I shall issue no orders. The duty must be voluntary.\"\\n\\nInstantly every man, from the veteran Trendon to the youthful paymaster,\\nvolunteered.\\n\\n\"That is what I expected,\" said Captain Parkinson quietly. \"But I have\\nstill a word to say. I make no doubt in my own mind that the schooner has\\ntwice been beset by the gravest of perils. Nothing less would have driven\\nMr. Edwards from his post. All of us who know him will appreciate that.\\nNor can I free myself from the darkest forebodings as to his fate and\\nthat of his companions. But as to the nature of the peril I am unable to\\nmake any conjecture worthy of consideration. Has anyone a theory to\\noffer?\"\\n\\nThere was a dead silence.\\n\\n\"Mr. Barnett? Dr. Trendon? Mr. Ives?\"\\n\\n\"Is there not possibly some connection between the unexplained light\\nwhich we have twice seen, and the double desertion of the ship?\"\\nsuggested the first officer, after a pause.\\n\\n\"I have asked myself that over and over. Whatever the source of the light\\nand however near to it the schooner may have been, she is evidently\\nunharmed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Barnett. \"That seems to vitiate that explanation.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, gentlemen, for the promptitude of your offers,\" continued\\nthe captain. \"In this respect you make my duty the more difficult. I\\nshall accept Mr. Ives because of his familiarity with sailing craft and\\nwith these seas.\" His eyes ranged the group.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, Captain Parkinson,\" eagerly put in the paymaster,\\n\"but I\\'ve handled a schooner yacht for several years and I\\'d appreciate\\nthe chance of----\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Mr. McGuire, you shall be the second in command.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You gentlemen will pick a volunteer crew and go aboard at once. Spare no\\neffort to find records of the schooner\\'s cruise. Keep in company and\\nwatch for signals. Report at once any discovery or unusual incident,\\nhowever slight.\"\\n\\nNot so easily was a crew obtained. Having in mind the excusable\\nsuperstition of the men, Captain Parkinson was unwilling to compel any of\\nthem to the duty. Awed by the mystery of their mates\\' disappearance, the\\nsailors hung back. Finally by temptation of extra prize money, a\\ncomplement was made up.\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock of a puffy, mist-laden morning a new and strong crew of\\nnine men boarded the _Laughing Lass_. There were no farewells among\\nthe officers. Forebodings weighed too heavy for such open expression.\\n\\nAll the fates of weather seemed to combine to part the schooner from her\\nconvoy. As before, the fog fell, only to be succeeded by squally\\nrain-showers that cut out the vista into a checkerboard pattern of\\nvisible sea and impenetrable greyness. Before evening the _Laughing\\nLass_, making slow way through the mists, had become separated by a\\nleague of waves from the cruiser. One glimpse of her between mist areas\\nthe _Wolverines_ caught at sunset. Then wind and rain descended in\\nfurious volume from the southeast. The cruiser immediately headed about,\\nfollowing the probable course of her charge, which would be beaten far\\ndown to leeward. It was a gloomy mess on the warship. In his cabin,\\nCaptain Parkinson was frankly sea-sick: a condition which nothing but the\\nextreme of nervous depression ever induced in him.\\n\\nFor several hours the rain fell and the gale howled. Then the sky swiftly\\ncleared, and with the clearing there rose a great cry of amaze from stem\\nto stern of the _Wolverine_. For far toward the western horizon\\nappeared such a prodigy as the eye of no man aboard that ship had ever\\nbeheld. From a belt of marvellous, glowing gold, rich and splendid\\nstreamers of light spiralled up into the blackness of the heavens.\\n\\nIn all the colours of the spectrum they rose and fell; blazing orange,\\nsilken, wonderful, translucent blues, and shimmering reds. Below, a broad\\nband of paler hue, like sheet lightning fixed to rigidity, wavered and\\nrippled. All the auroras of the northland blended in one could but have\\npaled away before the splendour of that terrific celestial apparition.\\n\\nOn board the cruiser all hands stood petrified, bound in a stricture of\\nspeechless wonder. After the first cry, silence lay leaden over the ship.\\nIt was broken by a scream of terror from forward. The quartermaster who\\nhad been at the wheel came clambering down the ladder and ran along the\\ndeck, his fingers splayed and stiffened before him in the intensity of\\nhis panic.\\n\\n\"The needle! The compass!\" he shrieked.\\n\\nBarnett ran to the wheel house with Trendon at his heels. The others\\nfollowed. The needle was swaying like a cobra\\'s head. And as a cobra\\'s\\nhead spits venom, it spat forth a thin, steel-blue stream of lucent fire.\\nThen so swiftly it whirled that the sparks scattered from it in a tiny\\nshower. It stopped, quivered, and curved itself upward until it rattled\\nlike a fairy drum upon the glass shield. Barnett looked at Trendon.\\n\\n\"Volcanic?\" he said.\\n\\n\"\\'Mine eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the Lord,\\'\" muttered the\\nsurgeon in his deep bass, as he looked forth upon the streaming, radiant\\nheavens. \"It\\'s like nothing else.\"\\n\\nIn the west the splendour and the terror shot to the zenith. Barnett\\nwhirled the wheel. The ship responded perfectly.\\n\\n\"I though she might be bewitched, too,\" he murmured.\\n\\n\"You may heal her for the light, Mr. Barnett,\" said Captain Parkinson\\ncalmly. He had come from his cabin, all his nervous depression gone in\\nthe face of an imminent and visible danger.\\n\\nSlowly the great mass of steel swung to the unknown. For an hour the\\nunknown guided her. Then fell blackness, sudden, complete. After that\\nradiance the dazzled eye could make out no stars, but the look-out\\'s\\nkeen vision discerned something else.\\n\\n\"Ship afire,\" he shouted hoarsely.\\n\\n\"Where away?\"\\n\\n\"Two points to leeward, near where the light was, sir.\"\\n\\nThey turned their eyes to the direction indicated, and beheld a majestic\\nrolling volume of purple light. Suddenly a fiercer red shot it through.\\n\\n\"That\\'s no ship afire,\" said Trendon. \"Volcano in eruption.\"\\n\\n\"And the other?\" asked the captain.\\n\\n\"No volcano, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Billy Edwards wins his bet,\" said Forsythe, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"God grant he\\'s on earth to collect it,\" replied Barnett solemnly.\\n\\nNo one turned in that night. When the sun of June 8th rose, it showed an\\nocean bare of prospect except that on the far horizon where the chart\\nshowed no land there rose a smudge of dirty rolling smoke. Of the\\nschooner there was neither sign nor trace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nTHE CASTAWAYS\\n\\n\\n\"This ship,\" growled Carter, the second officer, to Dr. Trendon, as they\\nstood watching the growing smoke-column, \"is a worse hot-bed of rumours\\nthan a down-east village. That\\'s the third sea-gull we\\'ve had officially\\nreported since breakfast.\"\\n\\nAs he said, three distinct times the _Wolverine_ had thrilled to an\\nimminent discovery, which, upon nearer investigation, had dwindled to\\nnothing more than a floating fowl. Upon the heels of Carter\\'s complaint\\ncame another hail.\\n\\n\"Boat ahoy. Three points on the starboard bow.\"\\n\\n\"If that\\'s another gull,\" muttered Carter, \"I\\'ll have something to say to\\nyou, my festive lookout.\"\\n\\nThe news ran electrically through the cruiser, and all eyes were strained\\nfor a glimpse of the boat. The ship swung away to starboard.\\n\\n\"Let me know as soon as you can make her out,\" ordered Carter.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s certainly something there,\" said Forsythe, presently. \"I can\\nmake out a speck rising on the waves.\"\\n\\n\"Bit o\\' wreckage from Barnett\\'s derelict,\" muttered Trendon, scowling\\nthrough his glasses.\\n\\n\"Rides too high for a spar or anything of that sort,\" said the junior\\nlieutenant.\\n\\n\"She\\'s a small boat,\" came in the clear tones of the lookout, \"driftin\\'\\ndown.\"\\n\\n\"Anyone in her?\" asked Carter.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t make out yet, sir. No one\\'s in charge though, sir.\"\\n\\nCaptain Parkinson appeared and Carter pointed out the speck to him.\\n\\n\"Yes. Give her full speed,\" said the captain, replying to a question from\\nthe officer of the deck.\\n\\nForward leapt the swift cruiser, all too slow for the anxious hearts of\\nthose aboard. For there was not one of the _Wolverines_ who did not\\nexpect from this aimless traveller of desert seas at the least a leading\\nclue to the riddle that oppressed them.\\n\\n\"Aloft there!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Can you make out her build?\"\\n\\n\"Rides high, like a dory, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Wasn\\'t there a dory on the _Laughing Lass_?\" cried Forsythe.\\n\\n\"On her stern davits,\" answered Trendon.\\n\\n\"It is hardly probable that unattached small boats should be drifting\\nabout these seas,\" said Captain Parkinson, thoughtfully. \"If she\\'s a\\ndory, she\\'s the _Laughing Lass_\\'s boat.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what she is,\" said Barnett. \"You can see her build plain enough\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Barnett, will you go aloft and keep me posted?\" said the captain.\\n\\nThe executive officer climbed to join the lookout. As he ascended, those\\nbelow saw the little craft rise high and slow on a broad swell.\\n\\n\"Same dory,\" said Trendon. \"I\\'d swear to her in Constantinople.\"\\n\\n\"What else could she be?\" muttered Forsythe.\\n\\n\"Somethin\\' that looks like a man in the bottom of her,\" sang out the\\ncrow\\'s-nest. \"Two of \\'em, I think.\"\\n\\nFor five minutes there was stillness aboard, broken only by an occasional\\nlow-voiced conjecture. Then from aloft:\\n\\n\"Two men rolling in the bottom.\"\\n\\n\"Are they alive?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; not that I can see.\"\\n\\nThe wind, which had been extremely variable since dawn, now whipped\\naround a couple of points, swinging the boat\\'s stern to them. Barnet,\\nputting aside his glass for a moment, called down:\\n\\n\"That\\'s the one, sir. I can make out the name.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" said the captain quietly. \"We should have news, at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ives or McGuire,\" suggested Forsythe, in low tones.\\n\\n\"Or Billy Edwards,\" amended Carter.\\n\\n\"Not Edwards,\" said Trendon.\\n\\n\"How do you know?\" demanded Forsythe.\\n\\n\"Dory was aboard when we found her the second time, after Edwards had\\nleft.\"\\n\\n\"Can you make out which of the men are in her?\" hailed the captain.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t think it\\'s any of our people,\" came the astonishing reply from\\nBarnett.\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"I can see only one man\\'s face, sir. It isn\\'t Ives or McGuire. He\\'s a\\nstranger to me.\"\\n\\n\"It must be one of the crew, then.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, beg your parding,\" called the lookout. \"Nothin\\' like that in\\nour crew, sir.\"\\n\\nThe boat came down upon them swiftly. Soon the quarter-deck was looking\\ninto her. She was of a type common enough on the high seas, except that a\\nstep for a mast showed that she had presumably been used for skimming\\nabout open shores. Of her passengers, one lay forward, prone and quiet. A\\nlength of sail cloth spread over him made it impossible to see his garb.\\nAt his breast an ugly protuberance, outlined vaguely, hinted a deformity.\\n\\nThe other sprawled aft, and at a nearer sight of him some of the men\\nbroke out into nervous titters. There was some excuse, for surely such a\\nscarecrow had never before been the sport of wind and wave. A thing of\\nshreds he was, elaborately ragged, a face overrun with a scrub of beard,\\nand preternaturally drawn, surmounted by a stiff-dried, dirty, cloth\\nsemi-turban, with a wide, forbidding stain along the side, worked out the\\nlikeness to a make-up.\\n\\n\"My God!\" cackled Forsythe with an hysterical explosion; and again, \"My\\nGod!\"\\n\\nA long-drawn, irrepressible aspiration of expectancy rose from the\\nwarship\\'s decks as the stranger raised his haggard face, turned eyes\\nunseeingly upon them, and fell back. The forward occupant stirred not,\\nsave as the boat rolled.\\n\\nFrom between decks someone called out, sharply, an order. In the grim\\nsilence it seemed strangely incongruous that the measured business of a\\nship\\'s life should be going forward as usual. Something within the\\nnewcomer\\'s consciousness stirred to that voice of authority.\\nMechanically, like some huge, hideous toy, he raised first one arm, then\\nthe other, and hitched himself halfway up on the stern seat. His mouth\\nopened. His face wrinkled. He seemed groping for the meaning of a joke at\\nwhich he knew he ought to laugh. Suddenly from his lips in surprising\\nvolume, raucous, rasping, yet with a certain rollicking deviltry fit to\\nset the head a-tilt, burst a chanty:\\n\\n  \"Oh, their coffin was their ship, and their grave it was the sea:\\n    _Blow high, blow low, what care we!_\\n  And the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea:\\n    _Down on the coast of the high Barbaree-ee._\"\\n\\nLong-drawn, like the mockery of a wail, the minor cadence wavered through\\nthe stillness, and died away.\\n\\n\"The High Barbaree!\" cried Trendon.\\n\\n\"You know it?\" asked the captain, expectant of a clue.\\n\\n\"One of those cursed tunes you can\\'t forget,\" said the surgeon. \"Heard a\\nscoundrel of a beach-comber sing it years ago. Down in New Zealand, that\\nwas. When the fever rose on him he\\'d pipe up. Used to beat time with a\\nsteel hook he wore in place of a hand. The thing haunted me till I was\\nsorry I hadn\\'t let the rascal die. This creature might have learned it\\nfrom him. Howls it out exactly like.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see that that helps us any,\" said Forsythe, looking down on the\\npreparations that were making to receive the unexpected guests.\\n\\nWith a deftness which had made the _Wolverine_ famous in the navy\\nfor the niceties of seamanship, the great cruiser let down her tackle as\\nshe drew skilfully alongside, and made fast, preparatory to lifting the\\ndory gently to her broad deck. But before the order came to hoist away,\\none of the jackies who had gone down drew the covering back from the\\nstill figure forward, and turned it over. With a half-stifled cry he\\nshrank back. And at that the tension of soul and mind on the\\n_Wolverine_ snapped, breaking into outcries and sudden, sharp\\nimprecations. The face revealed was that of Timmins, the bo\\'s\\'n\\'s mate,\\nwho had sailed with the first vanished crew. A life preserver was\\nfastened under his arms. He was dead.\\n\\n\"I\\'m out,\" said the surgeon briefly, and stood with mouth agape. Never\\nhad the disciplined _Wolverines_ performed a sea duty with so ragged\\na routine as the getting in of the boat containing the live man and the\\ndead body. The dead seaman was reverently disposed and covered. As to the\\nsurvivor there was some hesitancy on the part of the captain, who was\\ninclined to send him forward until Dr. Trendon, after a swift scrutiny,\\nsuggested that for the present, at least, he be berthed aft. They took\\nthe stranger to Edwards\\'s vacant room, where Trendon was closeted with\\nhim for half an hour. When he emerged he was beset with questions.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t give any account of himself yet,\" said the surgeon. \"Weak and not\\nrightly conscious.\"\\n\\n\"What ails him?\"\\n\\n\"Enough. Gash in his scalp. Fever. Thirst and exhaustion. Nervous shock,\\ntoo, I think.\"\\n\\n\"How came he aboard the _Laughing Lass_?\" \"Does he know anything of\\nBilly?\" \"Was he a stow-away?\" \"Did you ask him about Ives and McGuire?\"\\n\"How came he in the small boat?\" \"Where are the rest?\"\\n\\n\"Now, now,\" said the veteran chidingly. \"How can I tell? Would you have\\nme kill the man with questions?\"\\n\\nHe left them to look at the body of the bo\\'s\\'n\\'s mate. Not a word had he\\nto say when he returned. Only the captain got anything out of him but\\ngrowling and unintelligible expressions, which seemed to be objurgatory\\nand to express bewildered cogitation.\\n\\n\"How long had poor Timmins been drowned?\" the captain had asked him, and\\nTrendon replied:\\n\\n\"Captain Parkinson, the man wasn\\'t drowned. No water in his lungs.\"\\n\\n\"Not drowned! Then how came he by his death?\"\\n\\n\"If I were to diagnose it under any other conditions I should say that he\\nhad inhaled flames.\"\\n\\nThen the two men stared at each other in blank impotency. Meantime the\\nscarecrow was showing signs of returning consciousness and a message was\\ndispatched for the physician. On his way he met Barnett, who asked and\\nreceived permission to accompany him. The stranger was tossing restlessly\\nin his bunk, opening and shutting his parched mouth in silent, piteous\\nappeal for the water that must still be doled to him parsimoniously.\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll try him with a little brandy,\" said Trendon, and sent for\\nthe liquor.\\n\\nBarnett raised the patient while the surgeon held the glass to his lips.\\nThe man\\'s hand rose, wavered, and clasped the glass.\\n\\n\"All right, my friend. Take it yourself, if you like,\" said Trendon.\\n\\nThe fingers closed. Tremulously held, the little glass tilted and rattled\\nagainst the teeth. There was one deep, eager spasm of swallowing. Then\\nthe fevered eyes opened upon the face of the _Wolverine_\\'s first\\nofficer.\\n\\n\"Prosit, Barnett,\" said the man, in a voice like the rasp of rusty metal.\\n\\nThe navy man straightened up as from a blow under the jaw.\\n\\n\"Be careful what you are about,\" warned Trendon, addressing his superior\\nofficer sharply, for Barnett had all but let his charge drop. His face\\nwas a puckered mask of amaze and incredulity.\\n\\n\"Did you hear him speak my name--or am I dreaming?\" he half whispered.\\n\\n\"Heard him plain enough. Who is he?\"\\n\\nThe man\\'s eyes closed, but he smiled a little--a singular, wry-mouthed,\\nwinning smile. With that there sprung from behind the brush of beard,\\nfilling out the deep lines of emaciation, a memory to the recognition of\\nBarnett; a keen and gay countenance that whisked him back across seven\\nyears time to the days of Dewey and the Philippines.\\n\\n\"Ralph Slade, by the Lord!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Of the _Laughing Lass_?\" cried Trendon.\\n\\n\"Of the _Laughing Lass_.\"\\n\\nSuch a fury of eagerness burned in the face of Barnett that Trendon\\ncautioned him. \"See here, Mr. Barnett, you\\'re not going to fire a\\nbroadside of disturbing questions at my patient yet a while. He\\'s in no\\ncondition.\"\\n\\nBut it was from the other that the questions came. Opening his eyes he\\nwhispered, \"The sailor? Where?\"\\n\\n\"Dead,\" said Trendon bluntly. Then, breaking his own rule of repression,\\nhe asked:\\n\\n\"Did he come off the schooner with you?\"\\n\\n\"Picked him up,\" was the straining answer. \"Drifting.\"\\n\\nThe survivor looked around him, then into Barnett\\'s face, and his mind\\ntoo, traversed the years.\\n\\n\"_North Dakota?_\" he queried.\\n\\n\"No; I\\'ve changed my ship,\" said Barnett. \"This is the _Wolverine_.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the _Laughing Lass_?\"\\n\\nBarnett shook his head.\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" begged Slade.\\n\\n\"Wait till you\\'re stronger,\" admonished Trendon.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t wait,\" said the weak voice. The eyes grew wild.\\n\\n\"Mr. Barnett, tell him the bare outline and make it short,\" said the\\nsurgeon.\\n\\n\"We sighted the _Laughing Lass_ two days ago. She was in good shape,\\nbut deserted. That is, we thought she was deserted.\"\\n\\nThe man nodded eagerly.\\n\\n\"I suppose you were aboard,\" said Barnett, and Trendon made a quick\\ngesture of impatience and rebuke.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Slade. \"Left three--four--don\\'t know how many nights ago.\"\\n\\nThe officers looked at each other. \"Go on,\" said Trendon to his\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"We put a crew aboard in command of an ensign,\" continued Barnett, \"and\\npicked up the schooner the next night, deserted. You must know about it.\\nWhere is Billy Edwards?\"\\n\\n\"Never heard of him,\" whispered the other.\\n\\n\"Ives and McGuire, then. They were there after--Great God, man!\" he\\ncried, his agitation breaking out, \"Pull yourself together! Give us\\nsomething to go on.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Barnett!\" said the surgeon peremptorily.\\n\\nBut the suggestion was working in the sick man\\'s brain. He turned to the\\nofficers a face of horror.\\n\\n\"Your man, Edwards--the crew--they left her? In the night?\"\\n\\n\"What does he mean?\" cried Barnett.\\n\\n\"The light! You saw it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; we saw a strange light,\" answered Trendon soothingly. Slade half\\nrose. \"Lost; all lost!\" he cried, and fell back unconscious. Trendon\\nexploded into curses. \"See what you\\'ve done to my patient,\" he fumed.\\nBarnett looked at him with contrite eyes.\\n\\n\"Better get out before he comes to,\" growled the surgeon. \"Nice way to\\ntreat a man half dead of exhaustion.\"\\n\\nIt was nearly an hour before Slade came back to the world again. The\\ndoctor forbade him to attempt speech. But of one thing he would not be\\ndenied. There was a struggle for utterance, then:\\n\\n\"The volcano?\" he rasped out.\\n\\n\"Dead ahead,\" was the reply.\\n\\n\"Stand by!\" grasped Slade. He strove to rise, to say something further,\\nbut endurance had reached its limit. The man was utterly done.\\n\\nDr. Trendon went on deck, his head sunk between his shoulders. For a\\nminute he was in earnest talk with the captain. Presently the\\n_Wolverine_\\'s engines slowed down, and she lay head to the waves,\\nwith just enough turn of the screw to hold her against the sea-way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nTHE FREE LANCE\\n\\n\\nBy the following afternoon Dr. Trendon reported his patient as quite\\nrecovered.\\n\\n\"Starved for water,\" proffered the surgeon. \"Tissues fairly dried out.\\nSoaked him up. Fed him broth. Put him to sleep. He\\'s all right. Just\\nwakes up to eat; then off again like a two-year old. Wonderful\\nconstitution.\"\\n\\n\"The gentleman wants to know if he can come on deck, sir,\" saluted an\\norderly.\\n\\n\"Waked up, eh. Come on, Barnett. Help me boost him on deck.\"\\n\\nThe two officers disappeared to return in a moment arm-in-arm with Ralph\\nSlade.\\n\\nNearly twenty-four hours\\' rest and skilful treatment had done wonders. He\\nwas still a trifle weak and uncertain, was still a little glad to lean on\\nthe arms of his companions, but his eye was bright and alert, and his\\nhollow cheeks mounted a slight colour. This, with the clothes lent him by\\nBarnett, transformed his appearance, and led Captain Parkinson to\\ncongratulate himself that he had not obeyed his first impulse to send the\\ncastaway forward with the men.\\n\\nThe officers pressed forward.\\n\\n\"Mighty glad to see you out.\" \"Hope you\\'ve got your pins under you\\nagain.\" \"Old man, I\\'m mighty glad we came along.\"\\n\\nThe chorus of greeting was hearty enough, but the journalist barely paid\\nthe courtesy of acknowledgment. His eye swept the horizon eagerly until\\nit rested on the cloud of volcanic smoke billowing up across the setting\\nsun. A sigh of relief escaped him.\\n\\n\"Where are we?\" he asked Barnett. \"I mean since you picked me up. How\\nlong ago was that, anyway?\"\\n\\n\"Yesterday,\" replied the navigating officer. \"We\\'ve stood off and on,\\nlooking for some of our men.\"\\n\\n\"Then that\\'s the same volcano----\"\\n\\nBarnett laughed softly. \"Well, they aren\\'t quite holding a caucus of\\nvolcanoes down in this country. One like that is enough.\"\\n\\nBut Slade brushed the remark aside.\\n\\n\"Head for it!\" he cried excitedly. \"We may be in time! There\\'s a man on\\nthat island.\"\\n\\n\"A man!\" \"Another!\" \"Not Billy Edwards?\" \"Not some of our boys?\"\\n\\nSlade stared at them bewildered.\\n\\n\"Hold on,\" interposed Dr. Trendon authoritatively. \"What\\'s his name?\" he\\ninquired of the journalist.\\n\\n\"Darrow,\" replied the latter. \"Percy Darrow. Do you know him?\"\\n\\n\"Who in Kamschatka is Percy Darrow?\" demanded Forsythe.\\n\\n\"Why, he\\'s the assistant.\" It\\'s a long story----\"\\n\\n\"Of course, it\\'s a long story. There\\'s a lot we want to know,\"\\ninterrupted Captain Parkinson. \"Quartermaster, head for the volcano\\nyonder. Mr. Slade, we want to know where you came from; and why you left\\nthe schooner, and who Percy Darrow is. And there\\'s dinner, so we\\'ll just\\nadjourn to the messroom and hear what you can tell us. But there\\'s one\\nthing we\\'re all anxious to know; how came you in the dory which we found\\nand left on the _Laughing Lass_ no later than two days ago?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t set eyes on the _Laughing Lass_ for--well, I don\\'t know\\nhow long, but it\\'s five days anyway, perhaps more,\" replied Slade.\\n\\nThey stared at him incredulously.\\n\\n\"Oh, I see!\" he burst out suddenly; \"there were twin dories on the\\nschooner. The other one\\'s still there, I suppose. Did you find her on the\\nstern davits?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, then. You see when I left----\"\\n\\nCaptain Parkinson\\'s raised hand checked him. \"If you will be so good, Mr.\\nSlade, let us have it all at once, after mess.\"\\n\\nAt table the young officers, at a sharp hint from Dr. Trendon, conversed\\non indifferent subjects until the journalist had partaken heartily of\\nwhat the physician allowed him. Slade ate with keen appreciation.\\n\\n\"I tell you, that\\'s good,\" he sighed, when he had finished. \"Real, live,\\nafter-dinner coffee, too. Why, gentlemen, I haven\\'t eaten a civilised\\nmeal, with all the trimmings, for over two years. Doctor, do you think a\\nlittle of the real stuff would hurt me? It\\'s a pretty dry yarning.\"\\n\\n\"One glass,\" growled the surgeon, \"no more.\"\\n\\n\"Scotch high-ball, then,\" voted Slade, \"the higher the better.\"\\n\\nThe steward brought a tall glass with ice, in which the newcomer mixed\\nhis drink. Then for quite a minute he sat silent, staring at the table,\\nhis fingers aimlessly rubbing into spots of wetness the water beads as\\nthey gathered on the outside of his glass. Suddenly he looked up.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to begin,\" he confessed. \"It\\'s too confounded\\nimprobable. I hardly believe it myself, now that I\\'m sitting here in\\nhuman clothes, surrounded by human beings. Old Scrubs, and the Nigger,\\nand Handy Solomon, and the Professor, and the chest, and the--well, they\\nwere real enough when I was caught in the mess. But I warn you, you are\\nnot going to believe me, and hanged if I blame you a bit.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve seen marvels ourselves in the last few days,\" encouraged Captain\\nParkinson.\\n\\n\"Fire ahead, man,\" advised Barnett impatiently. \"Just begin at the\\nbeginning and let it go at that.\"\\n\\nSlade sipped at his glass reflectively.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he at length, \"the best way to begin is to show you how I\\nhappened to be mixed up in it at all.\"\\n\\nThe officers unconsciously relaxed into attitudes of greater ease.\\nOverhead the lamps swayed gently to the swell. The dull throb of the\\nscrew pulsated. Stewards clad in white moved noiselessly, filling the\\nglasses, deferentially striking lights for the smokers, clearing away the\\nlast dishes of the repast.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a reporter by choice, and a detective by instinct,\" began Slade,\\nwith startling abruptness. \"Furthermore, I\\'m pretty well off. I\\'m what\\nthey call a free lance, for I have no regular desk on any of the\\njournals. I generally turn my stuff in to the _Star_ because they\\ntreat me well. In return it is pretty well understood between us that I\\'m\\nto use my judgment in regard to \\'stories\\' and that they\\'ll stand back of\\nme for expenses. You see, I\\'ve been with them quite a while.\"\\n\\nHe looked around the circle as though in appeal to the comprehension of\\nhis audience. Some of the men nodded. Others sipped from their glasses or\\ndrew at their cigars.\\n\\n\"I loaf around here and there in the world, having a good time\\ntravelling, visiting, fooling around. Every once in a while something\\ninterests me. The thing is a sort of instinct. I run it down. If it\\'s a\\ngood story, I send it in. That\\'s all there is to it.\" He laughed\\nslightly. \"You see, I\\'m a sort of magazine writer in method, but my stuff\\nis newspaper stuff. Also the game suits me. That\\'s why I play it. That\\'s\\nwhy I\\'m here. I have to tell you about myself this way so you will\\nunderstand how I came to be mixed up in this _Laughing Lass_\\nmatter.\"\\n\\n\"I remember,\" commented Barnett, \"that when you came aboard the _South\\nDakota_, you had a little trouble making Captain Arnold see it.\" He\\nturned to the others with a laugh. \"He had all kinds of papers of ancient\\ndate, but nothing modern--letter from the _Star_ dated five years\\nback, recommendations to everybody on earth, except Captain Arnold,\\ncertificate of bravery in Apache campaign, bank identifications, and all\\nthe rest. \\'Maybe you\\'re the _Star\\'s_ correspondent, and maybe you\\'re\\nnot,\\' said the Captain, \\'I don\\'t see anything here to prove it.\\' Slade\\nargued an hour; no go. Remember how you caught him?\" he inquired of\\nSlade.\\n\\nThe reporter grinned assent.\\n\\n\"After the old man had turned him down for good, Slade fished down in his\\nwarbag and hauled out an old tattered document from an oilskin case.\\n\\'Hold on a minute,\\' said he, \\'you old shellback. I\\'ve proved to you that\\nI can write; and I\\'ve proved to you that I have fought, and now here I\\'ll\\nprove to you that I can sail. If writing, fighting, and sailing don\\'t fit\\nme adequately to report any little disturbances your antiquated\\nwashboiler may blunder into, I\\'ll go to raising cabbages.\\' With that he\\npresented a master\\'s certificate! Where did you get it, anyway? I never\\nfound out.\"\\n\\n\"Passed as \\'fresh-water\\' on the Great Lakes,\" replied Slade briefly.\\n\\n\"Well, the spunk and the certificate finished the captain. He was an old\\nsquare rigger himself in the Civil War.\"\\n\\n\"So much for myself,\" Slade continued. \"As for the _Laughing\\nLass_----\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART TWO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BRASS BOUND CHEST\\n\\n_Being the story told by Ralph Slade, Free Lance, to the officers of\\nthe United States cruiser Wolverine_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nTHE BARBARY COAST\\n\\n\\nA coincidence got me aboard her. I\\'ll tell you how it was. One evening\\nlate I was just coming out of a dark alley on the Barbary Coast, San\\nFrancisco. You know--the water front, where you can hear more tongues\\nthan at Port Said, see stranger sights, and meet adventure with the\\njoyous certainty of mediaeval times. I\\'d been down there hunting up a man\\nreported, by a wharf-rat of my acquaintance, to have just returned from a\\ntwo years\\' whaling voyage. He\\'d been \"shanghaied\" aboard, and as a matter\\nof fact, was worth nearly a million dollars. Landed in the city without a\\ncent, could get nobody to believe him, nor trust him to the extent of a\\ntelegram East. Wharf-rat laughed at his yarn; but I believe it was true.\\nGood copy anyway----\\n\\nJust at the turn of the alley I nearly bumped into two men. On the\\nBarbary Coast you don\\'t pass men in narrow places until you have\\nreconnoitered a little. I pulled up, thanking fortune that they had not\\nseen me. The first words were uttered in a voice I knew well.\\n\\nYou\\'ve all heard of Dr. Karl Augustus Schermerhorn. He did some big\\nthings, and had in mind still bigger. I\\'d met him some time before in\\nconnection with his telepathy and wireless waves theory. It was\\npicturesque stuff for my purpose, but wasn\\'t in it with what the old\\nfellow had really done. He showed me--well, that doesn\\'t matter. The\\npoint is, that good, staid, self-centred, or rather science-centred, Dr.\\nSchermerhorn was standing at midnight in a dark alley on the Barbary\\nCoast in San Francisco talking to an individual whose facial outline at\\nleast was not ornamental.\\n\\nMy curiosity, or professional instinct, whichever you please, was all\\naroused. I flattened myself against the wall.\\n\\nThe first remark I lost. The reply came to me in a shrill falsetto. So\\ngrotesque was the effect of this treble from a bulk so squat and broad\\nand hairy as the silhouette before me that I almost laughed aloud.\\n\\n\"I guess you\\'ve made no mistake on that. I\\'m her master, and her owner\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I haf been told you might rent her,\" said the Doctor.\\n\\n\"Rent her!\" mimicked the falsetto. \"Well, that--hell, yes, I\\'ll\\n_rent_ her!\" he laughed again.\\n\\n\"Doch recht.\" The Doctor was plainly at the end of his practical\\nresources.\\n\\nAfter waiting a moment for something more definite, the falsetto inquired\\nrather drily:\\n\\n\"How long? What to? What for? Who are you, anyway?\"\\n\\n\"I am Dr. Schermerhorn,\" the latter answered.\\n\\n\"Seen pieces about you in the papers.\"\\n\\n\"How many men haf you in the crew?\"\\n\\n\"Me and the mate and the cook and four hands.\"\\n\\n\"And you could go--soon?\"\\n\\n\"Soon as you want--_if_ I go.\"\\n\\n\"I wish to leaf to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"If I can get the crew together, I might make it. But say, let\\'s not hang\\nout here in this run of darkness. Come over to the grog shop yonder where\\nwe can sit down.\"\\n\\nTo my relief, for my curiosity was fully aroused--Dr. Schermerhorn\\'s\\nmovements are usually productive--this proposal was vetoed.\\n\\n\"No, no!\" cried the Doctor, with some haste, \"this iss well! Somebody\\nmight oferhear.\"\\n\\nThe huge figure stirred into an attitude of close attention. After a\\npause the falsetto asked deliberately:\\n\\n\"Where we goin\\'?\"\\n\\n\"I brefer not to say.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! How long a cruise?\"\\n\\n\"I want to rent your schooner and your crew as-long-as I-please-to\\nremain.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! How long\\'s that likely to be?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe a few months; maybe seferal years.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! Unknown port; unknown cruise. See here, anything crooked in this?\"\\n\\n\"No, no! Not at all! It iss simply business of my own.\"\\n\\n\"Not that I care,\" commented the other easily, \"only risks is worth\\npaying for.\"\\n\\n\"There shall not be risk.\"\\n\\n\"Pearls likely?\" hazarded the other, without much heed to the assurance.\\n\"Them Jap gunboats is getting pretty hard to dodge of late years.\\nHowever, I\\'ve dodged \\'em before.\"\\n\\n\"Now as to pay--how mooch iss your boat worth?\"\\n\\nI could almost follow the man\\'s thoughts as he pondered how much he dared\\nask.\\n\\n\"Well, you see, for a proposition like that--don\\'t know where we\\'re\\ngoing, when we\\'re going to get back,--and them gunboats--how would a\\nhundred and twenty-five a month strike you?\"\\n\\n\"Double it up. I want you to do ass I say, and I will also give your crew\\ndouble wages. Bud I want goot men, who will stay, and who will keep the\\nmouth shut.\"\\n\\n\"Gosh all fish-hooks! They\\'d go to hell with you for that!\"\\n\\n\"Now you can get all you want of Adams & Marsh. Tell them it iss for me,\\nBrovisions for three years, anyhow. Be ready to sail to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Tide turns at eight in the evening.\"\\n\\n\"I will send some effects in the morning.\"\\n\\nThe master hesitated.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, Doctor, but how do I know it\\'s all right? Maybe by\\nmorning you\\'ll change your mind.\"\\n\\n\"That cannot be. My plans are all----\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the usual thing to pay something----\"\\n\\n\"Ach, but yes. I haf forgot. Darrow told me. I will make you a check. Let\\nus go to the table of which you spoke.\"\\n\\nThey moved away, still talking. I did not dare follow them into the\\nlight, for I feared that the Doctor would recognise me. I\\'d have given my\\neye teeth, though, to have gathered the name of the schooner, or that of\\nher master. As it was, I hung around until the two had emerged from the\\ncorner saloon. They paused outside, still talking earnestly. I ventured a\\nhasty interview with the bar-keeper.\\n\\n\"Did you notice the two men who were sitting at the middle table?\" I\\nasked him.\\n\\n\"Sure!\" said he, shoving me my glass of beer.\\n\\n\"Know them?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"Never laid eyes on \\'em before. Old chap looked like a sort of corn\\ndoctor or corner spell-binder. Other was probably one of these longshore\\nabalone men.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" I muttered, and dodged out again, leaving the beer untouched.\\n\\nI cursed myself for a blunderer. When I got to the street the two men had\\ndisappeared. I should have shadowed the captain to his vessel.\\n\\nThe affair interested me greatly. Apparently Dr. Schermerhorn was about\\nto go on a long voyage. I prided myself on being fairly up to date in\\nregard to the plans of those who interested the public; and the public at\\nthat time was vastly interested in Dr. Schermerhorn. I, in common with\\nthe rest of the world, had imagined him anchored safely in Philadelphia,\\nimmersed in chemical research. Here he bobbed up at the other end of the\\ncontinent, making shady bargains with obscure shipping captains, and\\npaying a big premium for absolute secrecy. It looked good.\\n\\nAccordingly I was out early the next morning. I had not much to go by;\\nschooners are as plenty as tadpoles in San Francisco harbour. However, I\\nwas sure I could easily recognise that falsetto voice; and I knew where\\nthe supplies were to be purchased. Adams & Marsh are a large firm, and\\ncautious. I knew better than to make direct inquiries, or to appear in\\nthe salesroom. But by hanging around the door of the shipping room I soon\\nhad track of the large orders to be sent that day. In this manner I had\\nno great difficulty in following a truck to Pier 10, nor to identify a\\nconsignment to Captain Ezra Selover as probably that of which I was in\\nsearch.\\n\\nThe mate was in charge of the stowage, so I could not be quite sure.\\nHere, however, was a schooner--of about a hundred and fifty tons burden.\\nI looked her over.\\n\\nYou\\'re all acquainted with the _Laughing Lass_ and the perfection of\\nher lines. You have not known her under Captain Ezra Selover. She was the\\ncleanest ship I ever saw. Don\\'t know how he accomplished it, with a crew\\nof four and the cook; but he did. The deck looked as though it had been\\nholystoned every morning by a crew of jackies; the stays were whipped and\\ntarred, the mast new-slushed, and every foot of running gear coiled down\\nshipshape and Bristol fashion. There was a good deal of brass about her;\\nit shone like gold, and I don\\'t believe she owned an inch of paint that\\nwasn\\'t either fresh or new-scrubbed.\\n\\nI gazed for some time at this marvel. It\\'s unusual enough anywhere, but\\naboard a California hooker it is little short of miraculous. The crew had\\nall turned up, apparently, and a swarm of stevedores were hustling every\\nsort of provisions, supplies, stock, spars, lines and canvas down into\\nthe hold. It was a rush job, and that mate was having his hands full. I\\ndidn\\'t wonder at his language nor at his looks, both of which were\\nsomewhat mussed up. Then almost at my elbow I heard that shrill falsetto\\nsqueal, and turned just in time to see the captain ascend the after\\ngangplank.\\n\\nHe was probably the most dishevelled and untidy man I ever laid my eyes\\non. His hair and beard were not only long, but tangled and unkempt, and\\ngrew so far toward each other as barely to expose a strip of dirty brown\\nskin. His shoulders were bowed and enormous. His arms hung like a\\ngorilla\\'s, palms turned slightly outwards. On his head was jammed a linen\\nboating hat that had once been white; gaping away from his hairy chest\\nwas a faded dingy checked cotton shirt that had once been brown and\\nwhite; his blue trousers were spotted and splashed with dusty stains; he\\nwas chewing tobacco. A figure more in contrast to the exquisitely neat\\nvessel it would be hard to imagine.\\n\\nThe captain mounted the gangplank with a steadiness that disproved my\\nfirst suspicion of his having been on a drunk. He glanced aloft, cast a\\nspeculative eye on the stevedores trooping across the waist of the ship,\\nand ascended to the quarter-deck where the mate stood leaning over the\\nrail and uttering directed curses from between sweat-beaded lips. There\\nthe big man roamed aimlessly on what seemed to be a tour of casual\\ninspection. Once he stopped to breathe on the brass binnacle and to rub\\nit bright with the dirtiest red bandana handkerchief I ever want to see.\\n\\nHis actions amused me. The discrepancy between his personal habits and\\nhis particularity in the matter of his surroundings was exceedingly\\ninteresting. I have often noticed that such discrepancies seem to\\nindicate exceptional characters. As I watched him, his whole frame\\nstiffened. The long gorilla arms contracted, the hairy head sunk forward\\nin the tenseness of a serpent ready to strike. He uttered a shrill\\nfalsetto shriek that brought to a standstill every stevedore on the job;\\nand sprang forward to seize his mate by, the shoulder.\\n\\nEvidently the grasp hurt. I can believe it might, from those huge hands.\\nThe man wrenched himself about with an oath of inquiry and pain. I could\\nhear one side of what followed. The captain\\'s high-pitched tones carried\\nclearly; but the grumble and growl of the mate were indistinguishable at\\nthat distance.\\n\\n\"How far is it to the side of the ship, you hound of hell?\" shrieked the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nMumble--surprised--for an answer.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll tell you, you _swab_! It\\'s just two fathom from where\\nyou stand. Just two fathom! How long would it take you to walk there? How\\nlong? Just about six seconds! There and back! You--\" I won\\'t bother with\\nall the epithets, although by now I know Captain Selover\\'s vocabulary\\nfairly well. \"And you couldn\\'t take six seconds off to spit over the\\nside! Couldn\\'t walk two fathom! Had to spit on my quarter-deck, did you!\"\\n\\nRumble from the mate.\\n\\n\"No, by God, you won\\'t call up any of the crew. You\\'ll get a swab and do\\nit yourself. You\\'ll get a _hand_ swab and get down on your knees,\\ndamn you! I\\'ll teach you to be lazy!\"\\n\\nThe mate said something again.\\n\\n\"It don\\'t matter if we ain\\'t under way. That has nothing to do with it.\\nThe quarter-deck is clean, if the waist ain\\'t, and nobody but a damn\\nmisbegotten son-of-a-sea-lawyer would spit on deck anyhow!\" From this\\nCaptain Selover went on into a good old-fashioned deep-sea \"cussing out,\"\\nto the great joy of the stevedores.\\n\\nThe mate stood it pretty well, but there comes a time when further talk\\nis useless even in regard to a most heinous offense. And, of course, as\\nyou know, the mate could hardly consider himself very seriously at fault.\\nWhy, the ship was not yet at sea, and in all the clutter of charging. He\\nbegan to answer back. In a moment it was a quarrel. Abruptly it was a\\nfight. The mate marked Selover beneath the left eye. The captain with\\nbeautiful simplicity crushed his antagonist in his gorilla-like squeeze,\\ncarried him to the side of the vessel, and dropped him limp and beaten to\\nthe pier. And the mate was a good stout specimen of a sea-farer, too.\\n\\nThen the captain rushed below, emerging after an instant with a chest\\nwhich he flung after his subordinate. It was followed a moment later by a\\nstream of small stuff,--mingled with language--projected through an open\\nport-hole. This in turn ceased. The captain reappeared with a pail and\\nbrush, scrubbed feverishly at the offending spot, mopped it dry with that\\nsame old red bandana handkerchief, glared about him,--and abruptly became\\nas serene and placid as a noon calm. He took up the direction of the\\nstevedores. It was all most astounding.\\n\\nNobody paid any attention to the mate. He looked toward the ship once or\\ntwice, thought better of it, and began to pick up his effects, muttering\\nsavagely. In a moment or so he threw his chest aboard an outgoing truck\\nand departed.\\n\\nIt was now nearly noon and I was just in the way of going for something\\nto eat, when I caught sight of another dray laden with boxes and crated\\naffairs which I recognised as scientific apparatus. It was followed in\\nquick succession by three others. Ignorant as I was of the requirements\\nof a scientist, my common sense told me this could be no exploring\\noutfit. I revised my first intention of going to the club, and bought a\\nsandwich or two at the corner coffee house. I don\\'t know why, but even\\nthen the affair seemed big with mystery, with the portent of tragedy.\\nPerhaps the smell of tar was in my nostrils and the sea called. It has\\nalways possessed for me an extraordinary allurement----\\n\\nA little after two o\\'clock a cab drove to the after gangplank and\\nstopped. From it alighted a young man of whom I shall later have occasion\\nto tell you more, followed by Dr. Schermerhorn. The young man carried\\nonly a light leather \"serviette,\" such as students use abroad; while the\\ndoctor fairly staggered under the weight of a square, brass-bound chest\\nwithout handles. The singularity of this unequal division of labour\\nstruck me at once.\\n\\nIt struck also one of the dock men, who ran forward, eager for a tip.\\n\\n\"Kin I carry th\\' box for you, boss?\" he asked, at the same time reaching\\nfor it.\\n\\nThe doctor\\'s thin figure seemed fairly to shrink at the idea.\\n\\n\"No, no!\" he cried. \"It iss not for you to carry!\"\\n\\nHe hastened up the gangplank, clutching the chest close. At the top\\nCaptain Selover met him.\\n\\n\"Hello, doctor,\" he squeaked. \"Here in good time. We\\'re busy, you see.\\nLet me carry your chest for you.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" Dr. Schermerhorn fairly glared.\\n\\n\"It\\'s almighty heavy,\" insisted the captain. \"Let me give you a hand.\"\\n\\n\"You must not _touch!_\" emphatically ordered the scientist. \"Where\\niss the cabin?\"\\n\\nHe disappeared down the companionway clasping his precious load. The\\nyoung man remained on deck to superintend the stowing of the scientific\\ngoods and the personal baggage.\\n\\nAll this time I had been thinking busily. I remembered distinctly one\\nother instance when Dr. Schermerhorn had disappeared. He came back\\ninscrutably, but within a week his results on aerial photography were\\npublic property. I told myself that in the present instance his lavish\\nuse of money, the elaborate nature of his preparations, the evident\\nsecrecy of the expedition as evidenced by the fact that he had negotiated\\nfor the vessel only the day before setting sail, the importance of\\npersonal supervision as proved by the fact that he--notoriously\\nimpractical in practical matters, and notoriously disliking anything to\\ndo with business--had conducted the affair himself instead of delegating\\nit,--why; gentlemen, don\\'t you see that all this was more than enough to\\nwake me up, body and soul? Suddenly I came to a definite resolution.\\nCaptain Selover had descended to the pier. I approached him.\\n\\n\"You need a mate,\" said I.\\n\\nHe looked me over.\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" he admitted. \"Where\\'s your man?\"\\n\\n\"Right here,\" said I.\\n\\nHis eyes widened a little. Otherwise he showed no sign of surprise. I\\ncursed my clothes.\\n\\nFortunately I had my master\\'s certificate with me--I\\'d passed\\nfresh-water on the Great Lakes--I always carry that sort of document on\\nthe chance that it may come handy. It chanced to have a couple of naval\\nendorsements, results of the late war.\\n\\n\"Look here,\" I said before I gave it to him. \"You don\\'t believe in me. My\\nclothes are too good. That\\'s all right. They\\'re all I have that are good.\\nI\\'m broke. I came down here wondering whether I\\'d better throw myself in\\nthe drink.\"\\n\\n\"You look like a dude,\" he squeaked. \"Where did you ever ship?\"\\n\\nI handed him my certificate. The endorsements from Admiral Keays and\\nCaptain Arnold impressed him. He stared at me again, and a gleam of\\ncunning crept into his eyes.\\n\\n\"Nothing crooked about this?\" he breathed softly.\\n\\nI had the key to this side of his character. You remember I had overheard\\nthe night before his statement of his moral scruples. I said nothing, but\\nlooked knowing.\\n\\n\"What was it?\" he murmured. \"Plain desertion, or something worse?\"\\n\\nI remained inscrutable.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he conceded, \"I do need a mate; and a naval man--even if he is\\nwantin\\' to get out of sight----\"\\n\\n\"He won\\'t spit on your decks, anyway,\" I broke in boldly.\\n\\nCaptain Selover\\'s hairy face bristled about the mouth. This I\\nsubsequently discovered was symptom of a grin.\\n\\n\"You saw that, eh?\" he trebled.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you afraid he\\'ll bring down the police and delay your sailing?\" I\\nasked.\\n\\nHe grinned again, with a cunning twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t worry. There ain\\'t goin\\' to be any police. He had his\\nadvance money, and he won\\'t risk it by tryin\\' to come back.\"\\n\\nWe came to an agreement. I professed surprise at the wages. The captain\\nguardedly explained that the expedition was secret.\\n\\n\"What\\'s our port?\" I asked, to test him.\\n\\n\"Our papers are made out for Honolulu,\" he replied.\\n\\nWe adjourned to sign articles.\\n\\n\"By the way,\" said I, \"I wish you wouldn\\'t make them out in my own name.\\n\\'Eagen\\' will do.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" he laughed, \"I _sabe_. Eagen it is.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be aboard at six,\" said I. \"I\\'ve got to make some arrangements.\"\\n\\n\"Wish you could help with the lading,\" said he. \"Still, I can get along.\\nWant any advance money?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I replied; then I remembered that I was supposed to be broke.\\n\"Yes,\" I amended.\\n\\nHe gave me ten dollars.\\n\\n\"I guess you\\'ll show up,\" he said. \"Wouldn\\'t do this to everybody. But a\\nnaval man--even if he is dodgin\\' Uncle Sam----\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be here,\" I assured him.\\n\\nAt that time I wore a pointed beard. This I shaved. Also I was accustomed\\nto use eye-glasses. The trouble was merely a slight astigmatism which\\nbothered me only in reading or close inspection. I could get along\\nperfectly well without the glasses, so I discarded them. I had my hair\\ncut rather close. When I had put on sea boots, blue trousers and shirt, a\\npea jacket and a cap I felt quite safe from the recognition of a man like\\nDr. Schermerhorn. In fact, as you shall see, I hardly spoke to him during\\nall the voyage out.\\n\\nPromptly at six, then, I returned with a sea chest, bound I knew not\\nwhither, to be gone I knew not for how long, and pledged to act as second\\nofficer on a little hundred-and-fifty-ton schooner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nTHE GRAVEN IMAGE\\n\\n\\nI had every reason to be satisfied with my disguise,--if such it could\\nbe called. Captain Selover at first failed to recognise me. Then he burst\\ninto his shrill cackle.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t know you,\" he trebled. \"But you look shipshape. Come, I\\'ll show\\nyou your quarters.\"\\n\\nImmediately I discovered what I had suspected before; that on so small a\\nschooner the mate took rank with the men rather than the afterguard.\\nCabin accommodations were of course very limited. My own lurked in the\\nwaist of the ship--a tiny little airless hole.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s where Johnson stayed,\" proffered Selover. \"You can bunk here, or\\nyou can go in the foc\\'sle with the men. They\\'s more room there. We\\'ll get\\nunder way with the turn of the tide.\"\\n\\nHe left me. I examined the cabin. It was just a trifle larger than its\\nsingle berth, and the berth was just a trifle larger than myself. My\\nchest would have to be left outside. I strongly suspected that my lungs\\nwould have to be left outside also; for the life of me I could not see\\nwhere the air was to come from. With a mental reservation in favour of\\ninvestigating the forecastle, I went on deck.\\n\\nThe _Laughing Lass_ was one of the prettiest little schooners I ever\\nsaw. Were it not for the lines of her bilges and the internal arrangement\\nof her hold, it might be imagined she had been built originally as a\\npleasure yacht. Even the rake of her masts, a little forward of the\\nplumb, bore out this impression, which a comparatively new suit of\\ncanvas, well stopped down, brass stanchions forward, and two little guns\\nunder tarpaulins, almost confirmed. One thing struck me as peculiar. Her\\ncomplement of boats was ample enough. She had two surf boats, a dingy,\\nand a dory slung to the davits. In addition another dory,--the one you\\npicked me up in--was lashed to the top of the deck house.\\n\\n\"They\\'d mighty near have a boat apiece,\" I thought, and went forward.\\n\\nJust outside the forecastle hatch I paused. Someone below was singing in\\na voice singularly rich in quality. The words and the quaintness of the\\nminor air struck me immensely and have clung to my memory like a burr\\never since.\\n\\n  \"\\'Are you a man-o\\'-war or a privateer,\\' said he.\\n    _Blow high, blow low, what care we!_\\n  \\'Oh, I am a jolly pirate, and I\\'m sailing for my fee.\\'\\n    _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e.\"_\\n\\nI stepped to the companion. The voice at once ceased. I descended.\\n\\nA glimmer of late afternoon struggled through the deadlights. I found\\nmyself in a really commodious space,--extending far back of where the\\nforward bulk-heads are usually placed,--accommodating rows and row of\\nbunks--eighteen of them, in fact. The unlighted lamp cast its shadow on\\nwood stained black by much use, but polished like ebony from the\\ncontinued friction of men\\'s garments. I wish I could convey to you the\\nuncanny effect, this--of dropping from the decks of a miniature craft to\\nthe internal arrangements of a square-rigged ship. It was as though,\\nentering a cottage door, you were to discover yourself on the floor of\\nMadison Square Garden. A fresh sweet breeze of evening sucked down the\\nhatch. I immediately decided on the forecastle. Already it was being\\nborne in on me that I was little more than a glorified bo\\'s\\'n\\'s mate. The\\nsituation suited me, however. It enabled me to watch the course of events\\nmore safely, less exposed to the danger of recognition.\\n\\nI stood for a moment at the foot of the companion accustoming my eyes to\\nthe gloom. After a moment, with a shock of surprise, I made out a shining\\npair of bead-points gazing at me unblinkingly from the shadow under the\\nbitts. Slowly the man defined himself, as a shape takes form in a fog. He\\nwas leaning forward in an attitude of attention, his elbows resting on\\nhis knees, his forearms depending between them, his head thrust out. I\\ncould detect no faintest movement of eyelash, no faintest sound of\\nbreathing. The stillness was portentous. The creature was exactly like a\\nwax figure, one of the sort you meet in corridors of cheap museums and\\nfor a moment mistake for living beings. Almost I thought to make out the\\ncustomary grey dust lying on the wax of his features.\\n\\nI am going to tell you more of this man, because, as you shall see, he\\nwas destined to have much to do with my life, the fate of Dr. Karl\\nAugustus Schermerhorn, and the doom of the _Laughing Lass_.\\n\\nHe wore on his head a red bandana handkerchief. I never saw him with\\nother covering. From beneath It straggled oily and tangled locks of\\nglossy black. His face was long, narrow, hook-nosed and sinister; his\\neyes, as I have described them, a steady and beady black. I could at\\nfirst glance ascribe great activity, but only moderate strength to his\\nslender, wiry figure. In this I was mistaken. His sheer physical power\\nwas second only to that of Captain Selover. One of his forearms ended in\\na steel hook. At the moment I could not understand this; could not see\\nhow a man so maimed could be useful aboard a ship. Later I wished we had\\nmore as handy. He knew a jam hitch which he caught over and under his\\nhook quicker than most men can grasp a line with the naked hand. It would\\nrender one way, but held fast the other. He told me it was a cinch-hook\\nhitch employed by mule packers in the mountains, and that he had used it\\non swamp-hooks in the lumber woods of Michigan. I shouldn\\'t wonder. He\\nwas a Wandering Jew.--His name was Anderson, but I never heard him called\\nthat. It was always \"Handy Solomon\" with men and masters.\\n\\nWe stared at each other, I fascinated by something, some spell of the\\nship, which I have never been able to explain to myself--nor even\\ndescribe. It was a mystery, a portent, a premonition such as overtakes a\\nman sometimes in the dark passageways of life. I cannot tell you of it,\\nnor make you believe--let it pass----\\n\\nThen by a slow process of successive perceptions I became aware that I\\nwas watched by other eyes, other wax figures, other human beings with\\nunwavering gaze. They seemed to the sense of mystic apprehension that for\\nthe moment held possession of me, to be everywhere--in the bunks, on the\\nfloor, back in the shadows, watching, watching, watching from the\\nadvantage of another world.\\n\\n[Illustration: Slowly the man defined himself as a shape takes form in a\\nfog.]\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I tell you this; why I lay so much stress on the first\\nweird impression I got of the forecastle. It means something to me\\nnow--in view of all that happened subsequently. Almost can I look back\\nand see, in that moment of occultism, a warning, an enlightenment----But\\nthe point is, it meant something to me then. I stood there fascinated,\\nunable to move, unable to speak.\\n\\nThen the grotesque figure in the corner stirred.\\n\\n\"Well, mates,\" said the man, \"believe or not believe, it\\'s in the book,\\nand it stands to reason, too. We have gold mines here in Californy and\\nNevada and all them States; and we hear of gold mines in Mexico and\\nAustralia, too, but did you ever hear tell of gold mines in Europe? Tell\\nme that! And where did the gold come from then, before they discovered\\nAmerica? Tell me that! Why they made it, just as the man that wrote\\nthis-here says, and you can kiss the Book on that.\"\\n\\n\"How about that place, Ophir, I read about?\" asked a voice from the\\nbunks.\\n\\nThe man shot a keen glance thither from beneath his brows.\\n\\n\"Know last year\\'s output from the mines of Ophir, Thrackles?\" he inquired\\nin silky tones.\\n\\n\"Why, no,\" stammered the man addressed as Thrackles.\\n\\n\"Well I do,\" pursued the man with the steel hook, \"and it\\'s just the\\nwhole of nothing, and you can kiss the Book on that too! There ain\\'t any\\ngold output, because there ain\\'t any mines, and there never have been.\\nThey made their gold.\"\\n\\nHe tossed aside a book he had been holding in his left hand. I recognised\\nthe fat little paper duodecimo with amusement, and some wonder. The only\\nother copy I had ever laid my eyes on is in the Astor Library. It is\\nsomewhat of a rarity, called _The Secret of Alchemy, or the Grand\\nDoctrine of Transmutation Fully Explained_, and was written by a Dr.\\nEdward Duvall,--a most extraordinary volume to have fallen into the hands\\nof seamen.\\n\\nI stepped forward, greeting and being greeted. Besides the man I have\\nmentioned they were four. The cook was a bullet-headed squat negro with a\\nbroken nose. I believe he had a name,--Robinson, or something of that\\nsort. He was to all of us, simply the Nigger. Unlike most of his race, he\\nwas gloomy and taciturn.\\n\\nOf the other two, a little white-faced, thin-chested youth named Pulz,\\nand a villainous-looking Mexican called Perdosa, I shall have more to say\\nlater.\\n\\nMy arrival broke the talk on alchemy. It resumed its course in the\\ndirection of our voyage. Each discovered that the others knew nothing;\\nand each blundered against the astounding fact of double wages.\\n\\n\"All I know is the pay\\'s good; and that\\'s enough,\" concluded Thrackles,\\nfrom a bunk.\\n\\n\"The pay\\'s too good,\" growled Handy Solomon.\\n\\n\"This ain\\'t no job to go look at the \\'clipse of the moon, or the devil\\'s\\na preacher!\"\\n\\n\"W\\'at you maik heem, den?\" queried Perdosa.\\n\\n\"It\\'s treasure, of course,\" said Handy Solomon shortly.\\n\\n\"He, he, he!\" laughed the negro, without mirth.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, Doctor?\" demanded Thrackles.\\n\\n\"Treasure!\" repeated the Nigger. \"You see dat box he done carry so\\ncairful? You see dat?\"\\n\\nA pause ensued. Somebody scratched a match and lit a pipe.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t see that!\" broke out Thrackles finally, with some\\nimpatience. \"I _sabe_ how a man goes after treasure with a box; but\\nwhy should he take treasure away in a box? What do you think, Bucko?\" he\\nsuddenly appealed to me.\\n\\nI looked up from my investigation of the empty berths.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think much about it,\" I replied, \"except that by the look of the\\nstores we\\'re due for more than Honolulu; and from the look of the light\\nwe\\'d better turn to on deck.\"\\n\\nAn embarrassed pause fell.\\n\\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" bluntly demanded the man with the steel hook.\\n\\n\"My name is Eagen,\" I replied; \"I\\'ve the berth of mate. Which of these\\nbunks are empty?\"\\n\\nThey indicated what I desired with just a trace of sullenness. I\\nunderstood well enough their resentment at having a ship\\'s officer\\nquartered on them,--the forec\\'stle they considered as their only liberty\\nwhen at sea, and my presence as a curtailment to the freedom of speech. I\\nsubsequently did my best to overcome this feeling, but never quite\\nsucceeded.\\n\\nAt my command the Nigger went to his galley, I ascended to the deck. Dusk\\nwas falling, in the swift Californian fashion. Already the outlines of\\nthe wharf houses were growing indistinct, and the lights of the city were\\nbeginning to twinkle. Captain Selover came to my side and leaned over the\\nrail, peering critically at the black water against the piles.\\n\\n\"She\\'s at the flood,\" he squeaked. \"And here comes the Lucy Belle.\"\\n\\nThe tug took us in charge and puffed with us down the harbour and through\\nthe Golden Gate. We had sweated the canvas on her, even to the flying jib\\nand a huge club topsail she sometimes carried at the main, for the\\nafternoon trades had lost their strength. About midnight we drew up on\\nthe Farallones.\\n\\nThe schooner handled well. Our crew was divided into three watches--an\\nunusual arrangement, but comfortable. Two men could sail her handily in\\nmost sorts of weather. Handy Solomon had the wheel. Otherwise the deck\\nwas empty. The man\\'s fantastic headgear, the fringe of his curling oily\\nlocks, the hawk outline of his face momentarily silhouetted against the\\nphosphorescence astern as he glanced to windward, all lent him an\\nappearance of another day. I could almost imagine I caught the gleam of\\nsilver-butted horse pistols and cutlasses at his waist.\\n\\nI brooded in wonder at what I had seen and how little I had explained.\\nThe number of boats, sufficient for a craft of three times the tonnage;\\nthe capacity of the forec\\'stle with its eighteen bunks, enough for a\\npassenger ship,--what did it mean? And this wild, unkempt, villainous\\ncrew with its master and his almost ridiculous contrast of neatness and\\nfilth;--did Dr. Schermerhorn realise to what he had trusted himself and\\nhis precious expedition, whatever it might be?\\n\\nThe lights of shore had sunk; the _Laughing Lass_ staggered and\\nleaped joyously with the glory of the open sea. She seemed alone on the\\nbosom of the ocean; and for the life of me I could not but feel that I\\nwas embarked on some desperate adventure. The notion was utterly\\nillogical; that I knew well. In sober thought, I, a reporter, was\\nshadowing a respectable and venerable scientist, who in turn was probably\\nabout to investigate at length some little-known deep-sea conditions or\\nphenomena of an unexplored island. But that did not suffice to my\\nimagination. The ship, its surroundings, its equipment, its crew--all\\nread fantastic. So much the better story, I thought, shrugging my\\nshoulders at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nTHE TWELVE REPEATING RIFLES\\n\\n\\nAfter my watch below the next morning I met Percy Darrow. In many ways he\\nis, or was, the most extraordinary of my many acquaintances. During that\\nfirst half hour\\'s chat with him I changed my mind at least a dozen times.\\nOne moment I thought him clever, the next an utter ass; now I found him\\nfrank, open, a good companion, eager to please,--and then a droop of his\\nblond eyelashes, a lazy, impertinent drawl of his voice, a hint of\\nhalf-bored condescension in his manner, convinced me that he was shy and\\naffected. In a breath I appraised him as intellectual, a fool, a shallow\\nmind, a deep schemer, an idler, and an enthusiast. One result of his\\nspasmodic confidences was to throw a doubt upon their accuracy. This\\nmight be what he desired; or with equal probability it might be the\\nchance reflection of a childish and aimless amiability.\\n\\nHe was tall and slender and pale, languid of movement, languid of eye,\\nlanguid of speech. His eyes drooped, half-closed beneath blond brows; a\\nlong wiry hand lazily twisted a rather affected blond moustache, his\\nvoice drawled his speech in a manner either insufferably condescending\\nand impertinent, or ineffably tired,--who could tell which?\\n\\nI found him leaning against the taffrail, his languid graceful figure\\nsupported by his elbows, his chin propped against his hand. As I\\napproached the binnacle, he raised his eyes and motioned me to him. The\\ninsolence of it was so superb that for a moment I was angry enough to\\nignore him. Then I reflected that I was here, not to stand on my personal\\ndignity, but to get information. I joined him.\\n\\n\"You are the mate?\" he drawled.\\n\\n\"Since I am on the quarter-deck,\" I snapped back at him.\\n\\nHe eyed me thoughtfully, while he rolled with one hand a corn-husk\\nMexican cigarette.\\n\\n\"Do you know where you are going?\" he inquired at length.\\n\\n\"Depends on the moral character of my future actions,\" I rejoined tartly.\\n\\nHe allowed a smile to break and fade, then lighted his cigarette.\\n\\n\"The first mate seems to have a remarkable command of language,\" said he.\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\n\"Well, to tell you the truth I don\\'t know where we are going,\" he\\ncontinued. \"Thought you might be able to inform me. Where did this ship\\nand its precious gang of cutthroats come from, anyway?\"\\n\\n\"Meaning me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, meaning you too, for all I know,\" he shrugged wearily. Suddenly he\\nturned to me and laid his hand on my shoulder with one of those sudden\\nbursts of confidence I came later to recognise and look for, but in which\\nI could never quite believe--nor disbelieve.\\n\\n\"I am eaten with curiosity,\" he stated in the least curious voice in the\\nworld. \"I suppose you know who his Nibs is?\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Schermerhorn, do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Well, I\\'ve been with him ten years. I am his right-hand man. All\\nhis business I transact down to the last penny. I even order his meals.\\nHis discoveries have taken shape in my hands. Suddenly he gets a freak.\\nHe will go on a voyage. Where? I shall know in good time. For how long? I\\nshall know in good time. For what purpose? Same answer. What\\naccommodations shall I engage? I experience the worst shock of my\\nlife;--he will engage them himself. What scientific apparatus? Shock\\nnumber two;--he will attend to that. Is there anything I can do? What do\\nyou suppose he says?\"\\n\\n\"How should I know?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"You should know in the course of intelligent conversation with me,\" he\\ndrawled. \"Well, he, good old staid Schermie with the vertebrated thoughts\\ngets kittenish. He says to me, \\'Joost imachin, Percy, you are\\nall-alone-on-a-desert-island placed; and that you will sit on those sands\\nand wish within yourself all you would buy to be comfortable. Go out and\\nbuy me those things--in abundance.\\' Those were my directions.\"\\n\\nHe puffed.\\n\\n\"What does he pay you?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"More than enough, by a good deal, I\\'ll bet,\" he rejoined. \"The old fool!\\nHe ought to have left it to me. What is this craft? Have you ever sailed\\non her before?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Have any of the crew?\"\\n\\nI replied that I believed all of them were Selover\\'s men. He threw the\\ncigarette butt into the sea and turned back.\\n\\n\"Well, I wish you joy of your double wages,\" he mocked.\\n\\nSo he knew that, after all! How much more of his ignorance was pretended\\nI had no means of guessing. His eye gleamed sarcastically as he sauntered\\ntoward the companion-way. Handy Solomon was at the wheel, steering easily\\nwith one foot and an elbow. His steel hook lay fully exposed, glittering\\nin the sunlight. Darrow glanced at it curiously, and at the man\\'s\\nheadgear.\\n\\n\"Well, my genial pirate,\" he drawled, \"if you had a line to fit that\\nhook, you\\'d be equipped for fishing.\" The man\\'s teeth bared like an\\nanimal\\'s, but Darrow went on easily as though unconscious of giving\\noffence. \"If I were you, I\\'d have it arranged so the hook would turn\\nbackward as well as forward. It would be handier for some\\nthings,--fighting, for instance.\"\\n\\nHe passed on down the companion. Handy Solomon glared after him, then\\ndown at his hook. He bent his arm this way and that, drawing the hook\\ntoward him softly, as a cat does her claws. His eyes cleared and a look\\nof admiration crept into them.\\n\\n\"By God, he\\'s right!\" he muttered, and after a moment; \"I\\'ve wore that\\nten year and never thought of it. The little son of a gun!\"\\n\\nHe remained staring for a moment at the hook. Then he looked up and\\ncaught my eye. His own turned quizzical. He shifted his quid and began to\\nhum:\\n\\n  \"The bos\\'n laid aloft, aloft laid he,\\n    _Blow high, blow low! What care we?_\\n  \\'There\\'s a ship upon the wind\\'ard, a wreck upon the lee,\\'\\n    _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e.\"_\\n\\nWe had entered the trades and were making good time. I was content to\\nstay on deck, even in my watch below. The wind was strong, the waves\\ndashing, the sky very blue. From under our forefoot the flying fish sped,\\nthe monsters pursued them. A tingle of spray was in the air. It was all\\nvery pleasant. The red handkerchief around Solomon\\'s head made a pretty\\nspot of colour against the blue of the sky and the darker blue of the\\nsea. Silhouetted over the flaw-less white of the deck house was the\\nsullen, polished profile of the Nigger. Beneath me the ship swerved\\nand leaped, yielded and recovered. I breathed deep, and saw cutlasses in\\nharmless shadows. It was two years ago. I was young--then----\\n\\nAt the mess hour I stood in doubt. However, I was informed by the\\ncaptain\\'s falsetto that I was to eat in the cabin. As the only other\\nofficer, I ate alone, after the others had finished, helping myself from\\nthe dishes left on the table. It was a handsome cabin, well kept, with\\nwhite woodwork spotlessly clean, leather cushions--much better than one\\nwould expect. I afterwards found that the neatness of this cabin and of\\nthe three staterooms was maintained by the Nigger--at peril of his neck.\\nA rack held a dozen rifles, five revolvers, and,--at last--my cutlasses.\\nI examined the lot with interest. They were modern weapons,--the new high\\npower 30-40 box-magazine rifle, shooting government ammunition,--and had\\nbeen used. The revolvers were of course the old 45 Colt\\'s. This was an\\nextraordinary armament for a peaceable schooner of one hundred and fifty\\ntons burden.\\n\\nThe rest of the cabin\\'s fittings were not remarkable. By the\\nconfiguration of the ship I guessed that two of the staterooms must be\\nrather large. I could make out voices within.\\n\\nOn deck I talked with Captain Selover.\\n\\n\"She\\'s a snug craft,\" I approached him.\\n\\nHe nodded.\\n\\n\"You have armed her well.\"\\n\\nHe muttered something of pirates and the China seas.\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\n\"You have arms enough to give your crew about two magazine rifles\\napiece--unless you filled all your berths forward!\"\\n\\nCaptain Selover looked me direct in the eye.\\n\\n\"Talk straight, Mr. Eagen,\" said he.\\n\\n\"What is this ship, and where is she bound?\" I asked, with equal\\nsimplicity.\\n\\nHe considered.\\n\\n\"As for the ship,\" he replied at length, \"I don\\'t mind saying. You\\'re my\\nfirst officer, and on you I depend if it comes to--well, the small arms\\nbelow. If the ship\\'s a little under the shade, why, so are you. She\\'s by\\nway of being called a manner of hard names by some people. I do not see\\nit myself. It is a matter of conscience. If you would ask some\\ninterested, they would call her a smuggler, a thief, a wrecker, and all\\nthe other evil titles in the catalogue. She has taken in Chinks by way of\\nSanta Cruz Island--if that is smuggling. The country is free, and a Chink\\nis a man. Besides, it paid ten dollars a head for the landing. She has\\ncarried in a cargo or so of junk; it was lying on the beach where a fool\\nmaster had piled it, and I took what I found. I couldn\\'t keep track of\\nthe underwriters\\' intentions.\"\\n\\n\"But the room forward----?\" I broke in.\\n\\n\"Well, you see, last season we were pearl fishing.\"\\n\\n\"But you needed only your diver and your crew,\" I objected.\\n\\n\"There was the matter of a Japanese gunboat or so,\" he explained.\\n\\n\"Poaching!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"So some call it. The shells are there. The islands are not inhabited. I\\ndo not see how men claim property beyond the tide water. I have heard it\\nargued----\"\\n\\n\"Hold on!\" I cried. \"There was a trouble last year in the Ishigaki Jima\\nIslands where a poacher beat off the _Oyama_. It was a desperate\\nfight.\"\\n\\nCaptain Selover\\'s eye lit up.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve commanded a black brigantine, name of _The Petrel_,\" he\\nadmitted simply. \"She was a brigantine aloft, but _alow_ she had\\nmuch the same lines as the _Laughing Lass_.\" He whirled on his heel\\nto roll to one of the covered yacht\\'s cannon. \"Looks like a harmless\\nlittle toy to burn black powder, don\\'t she?\" he remarked. He stripped off\\nthe tarpaulin and the false brass muzzle to display as pretty a little\\nMaxim as you would care to see. \"Now you know all about it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Look here, Captain Selover,\" I demanded, \"don\\'t you know that I could\\nblow your whole shooting-match higher than Gilderoy\\'s kite. How do you\\nknow I won\\'t do it when I get back? How do you know I won\\'t inform the\\ndoctor at once what kind of an outfit he has tied to?\"\\n\\nHe planted far apart his thick legs in their soiled blue trousers, pushed\\nback his greasy linen boating hat and stared at me with some amusement.\\n\\n\"How do you know I won\\'t blow on Lieutenant or Ensign Ralph Slade,\\nU.S.N., when I get back?\" he demanded. I blessed that illusion, anyway.\\n\"Besides, I know my man. You won\\'t do anything of the sort.\" He walked to\\nthe rail and spat carefully over the side.\\n\\n\"As for the doctor,\" he went on, \"he knows all about it. He told me all\\nabout myself, and everything I had ever done from the time I\\'d licked\\nBuck Jones until last season\\'s little diversion. Then he told me that was\\nwhy he wanted me to ship for this cruise.\" The captain eyed me\\nquizzically.\\n\\nI threw out my hands in a comic gesture of surrender.\\n\\n\"Well, where are we bound, anyway?\"\\n\\nThe dirty, unkempt, dishevelled figure stiffened.\\n\\n\"Mr. Eagen,\" its falsetto shrilled, \"you are mate of this vessel. Your\\nduty is to see that my orders as to sailing are carried out. Beyond that\\nyou do not go. As to navigation, and latitude and longitude and where the\\nhell we are, that is outside your line of duty. As to where we are bound,\\nyou are getting double wages not to get too damn curious. Remember to\\nearn your wages, Mr. Eagen!\"\\n\\nHe turned away to the binnacle. In spite of his personal filth, in spite\\nof the lawless, almost piratical, character of the man, in that moment I\\ncould not but admire him. If Percy Darrow was ignorant of the purposes of\\nthis expedition, how much more so Captain Selover. Yet he accepted his\\ntrust blindly, and as far as I could then see, intended to fulfil it\\nfaithfully. I liked him none the worse for snubbing me. It indicated a\\nstreak in his moral nature akin to and quite as curious as his excessive\\nneatness regarding his immediate surroundings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nTHE STEEL CLAW\\n\\n\\nDuring the next few days the crew discussed our destination. Discipline,\\nwhile maintained strictly, was not conventional. During the dog watches,\\noften, every man aboard would be below, for at that period Captain\\nSelover loved to take the wheel in person, a thick cigar between his\\nlips, the dingy checked shirt wide open to expose his hairy chest to the\\nbreeze. In the twilight of the forecastle we had some great sea-lawyer\\'s\\ntalks--I say \"We,\" though I took little part in them. Generally I lay\\nacross my bunk smoking my pipe while Handy Solomon held forth, his speech\\npunctuated by surly speculations from the Nigger, with hesitating\\ndeep-sea wisdom from the hairy Thrackles, or with voluminous bursts of\\nfractured English from Perdosa. Pulz had nothing to offer, but watched\\nfrom his pale green eyes. The light shifted and wavered from one to the\\nother as the ship swayed: garments swung; the empty berths yawned\\ncavernous. I could imagine the forecastle filled with the desperate men\\nwho had beaten off the _Oyama_. The story is told that they had\\nswept the gunboat\\'s decks with her own rapid-fires, turned in.\\n\\nNo one knew where we were going, nor why. The doctor puzzled them, and\\nthe quantity of his belongings.\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t pearls,\" said Handy Solomon. \"You can kiss the Book on that,\\nfor we ain\\'t a diver among us. It ain\\'t Chinks, for we are cruising\\nsou\\'-sou\\'-west. Likely it\\'s trade,--trade down in the Islands.\"\\n\\nWe were all below. The captain himself had the wheel. Discipline, while\\nstrict, was not conventional.\\n\\n\"Contrabandista,\" muttered the Mexican, \"for dat he geev us double pay.\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t get her for nothing,\" agreed Thrackles. \"Double pay and duff on\\nWednesday generally means get your head broke.\"\\n\\n\"No trade,\" said the Nigger gloomily.\\n\\nThey turned to him with one accord.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" demanded Pulz, breaking his silence.\\n\\n\"No trade,\" repeated the Nigger.\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t you got a reason, Doctor?\" asked Handy Solomon.\\n\\n\"No trade,\" insisted the Nigger.\\n\\nAn uneasy silence fell. I could not but observe that the others held the\\nNigger\\'s statements in a respect not due them as mere opinions.\\nSubsequently I understood a little more of the reputation he possessed.\\nHe was believed to see things hidden, as their phrase went.\\n\\nNobody said anything for some time; nobody stirred, except that Handy\\nSolomon, his steel claw removed from its socket, whittled and tested,\\nscrewed and turned, trying to fix the hook so that, in accordance with\\nthe advice of Percy Darrow, it would turn either way.\\n\\n\"What is it, then, Doctor?\" he asked softly at last.\\n\\n\"Gold,\" said the Nigger shortly. \"Gold--treasure.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I said at first!\" cried Handy Solomon triumphantly. It was\\nextraordinary, the unquestioning and entire faith with which they\\naccepted as gospel fact the negro\\'s dictum.\\n\\nThere followed much talk of the nature of this treasure, whether it was\\nto be sought or conveyed, bought, stolen, or ravished in fair fight. No\\nfurther soothsaying could they elicit from the Nigger. They followed\\ntheir own ideas, which led them nowhere. Someone lit the forecastle lamp.\\nThey settled themselves. Pulz read aloud.\\n\\nThis was the programme every day during the dog watch. Sometimes the\\nwatch on deck was absent, leaving only Handy Solomon, the Nigger and\\nPulz, but the order of the day was not on that account varied. They\\ntalked, they lit the lamp, they read. Always the talk was of the\\ntreasure.\\n\\nAs to the reading, it was of the sort usual to seamen, cowboys,\\nlumbermen, and miners. Thrackles had a number of volumes of very cheap\\nlove stories. Pulz had brought some extraordinary garish detective\\nstories. The others contributed sensational literature with paper covers\\nadorned lithographically. By the usual incongruity a fragment of _The\\nMarble Faun_ was included in the collection. The Nigger has his copy\\nof _Duvall on Alchemy_. I haven\\'t the slightest idea where he could\\nhave got it.\\n\\nWhile Pulz read, Handy Solomon worked on the alteration of his claw. He\\ncould never get it to hold, and I remember as an undertone to Pulz\\'s\\nreading, the rumble of strange, exasperated oaths. Whatever the evening\\'s\\nlecture, it always ended with the book on alchemy. These men had no\\nperspective by which to judge such things. They accepted its speculations\\nand theories at their face value. Extremely laughable were the\\ndiscussions that followed. I often wished the shade of old Duvall could\\nbe permitted to see these, his last disciples, spelling out dimly his\\nteachings, mispronouncing his grave utterances, but believing utterly.\\n\\nDr. Schermerhorn appeared on deck seldom. When he did, often his fingers\\nheld a pen which he had forgotten to lay aside. I imagined him\\npreoccupied by some calculation of his own, but the forecastle, more\\npicturesquely, saw him as guarding constantly the heavy casket he had\\nhimself carried aboard. He breathed the air, walked briskly, turned with\\nthe German military precision at the end of his score of strides, and\\nre-entered his cabin at the lapse of the half hour. After he had gone,\\nremained Percy Darrow leaning indolently against the taffrail, his\\ngraceful figure swaying with the ship\\'s motion, smoking always the\\ncorn-husk Mexican cigarettes which he rolled with one hand. He seemed\\nfrom that farthest point aft to hold in review the appliances, the\\nfabric, the actions, yes, even the very thoughts, of the entire ship.\\nFrom them he selected that on which he should comment or with which he\\nshould play, always with a sardonic, half-serious, quite wearied and\\nindifferent manner. His inner knowledge, viewed by the light of this\\nmanner or mannerism, was sometimes uncanny, though perhaps the sources of\\nhis information were commonplace enough, after all. Certainly he always\\nviewed with amusement his victim\\'s wonder.\\n\\nThus one evening at the close of our day-watch on deck, he approached\\nHandy Solomon. It was at the end of ten days, on no one of which had the\\nseaman failed to tinker away at his steel claw. Darrow balanced in front\\nof him with a thin smile.\\n\\n\"Too bad it doesn\\'t work, my amiable pirate,\" said he. \"It would be so\\nhandy for fighting--See here,\" he suddenly continued, pulling some object\\nfrom his pocket, \"here\\'s a pipe; present to me; I don\\'t smoke \\'em. Twist\\nher halfway, like that, she comes out. Twist her halfway, like this, she\\ngoes in. That\\'s your principle. Give her back to me when you get\\nthrough.\"\\n\\nHe thrust the briar pipe into the man\\'s hand, and turned away without\\nwaiting for a reply. The seaman looked after him in open amazement. That\\nevening he worked on the socket of the steel hook, and in two days he had\\nthe job finished. Then he returned the pipe to Darrow with some growling\\nof thanks.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" said the young man, smiling full at him. \"Now what\\nare you going to fight?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nTHE PHILOSOPHER\\'S STONE\\n\\n\\nCaptain Selover received as his due the most absolute and implicit\\nobedience imaginable. When he condescended to give an order in his\\nown person, the men fairly jumped to execute it. The matter had evidently\\nbeen threshed out long ago. They did not love him, not they; but they\\nfeared him with a mighty fear, and did not hesitate to say so,\\nvividly, and often, when in the privacy of the forecastle. The\\nprevailing spirit was that of the wild beast, cowed but snarling\\nstill. Pulz and Thrackles in especial had a great deal to say of what\\nthey were or were not going to do, but I noticed that their resolution\\nalways began to run out of them when first foot was set to the\\ncompanion ladder.\\n\\nOne day we were loafing along, everything drawing well, and everybody\\nbut the doctor on deck to enjoy the sun. I was in the crow\\'s-nest for\\nmy pleasure. Below me on the deck Captain Selover roamed here and\\nthere, as was his custom, his eye cocked out like a housewife\\'s for\\ndisorder. He found it, again in the evidence of expectoration, and\\nas Perdosa happened to be handiest, fell on the unfortunate Mexican.\\n\\nPerdosa protested that he had had nothing to do with it, but Captain\\nSelover, enraged as always when his precious deck was soiled, would\\nnot listen. Finally the Mexican grew sulky and turned away as though\\nrefusing to hear more. The captain thereupon felled him to the deck,\\nand began brutally to kick him in the face and head.\\n\\nPerdosa writhed and begged, but without avail. The other members of\\nthe crew gathered near. After a moment, they began to murmur. Finally\\nThrackles ventured, most respectfully, to intervene.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll kill him, sir,\" he interposed. \"He\\'s had enough.\"\\n\\n\"Had enough, has he?\" screeched the captain. \"Well, you take what\\'s\\nleft.\"\\n\\nHe marked Thrackles heavily over the eye. There was a breathless\\npause; and then Thrackles, Pulz, the Nigger, and Perdosa attacked at\\nonce.\\n\\nThey caught the master unawares, and bore him to the deck. I dropped\\nat once to the ratlines, and commenced my descent. Before I had\\nreached the deck, however, Selover was afoot again, the four hanging\\nto him like dogs. In a moment more he had shaken them off; and before\\nI could intervene, he had seized a belaying pin in either hand, and\\nwas hazing them up and down the deck.\\n\\n\"Mutiny, would you?\" he shrilled. \"You poor swabs! Forgot who was your\\ncaptain, did ye? Well, it\\'s Captain Ezra Selover, and you can lay to\\nthat! It would need about eight fathom of _stuff_ like you to\\ntie me down.\"\\n\\nHe chased them forward, and he chased them aft, and every time the\\npins fell, blood followed. Finally they dived like rabbits into the\\nforecastle hatch. Captain Selover leaned down after them.\\n\\n\"Now tie yourselves up,\" he advised, \"and then come on deck and clean\\nup after yourselves!\" He turned to me. \"Mr. Eagen, turn out the crew\\nto clean decks.\"\\n\\nI descended to the forecastle, followed immediately by Handy Solomon.\\nThe latter had taken no part in the affair. We found the men in\\nhorrible shape, what with the bruises and cuts, and bleeding freely.\\n\\n\"Now you\\'re a nice-looking Sunday school!\" observed Handy Soloman,\\neyeing them sardonically. \"Tackel Old Scrubs, will ye? Well, some\\nneeds a bale of cotton to fall on \\'em afore they learns anything.\\nEnjoyed your little diversions, mates? And w\\'at do you expect to gain?\\nI asks you that, now. You poor little infants! Ain\\'t you never tackled\\nhim afore? Don\\'t remember a little brigatine, name of the\\n_Petrel!_ My eye, but you _are_ a pack of damn fools!\"\\n\\nTo this he received no reply. The men sullenly assisted each other.\\nThen they went immediately on deck and to work.\\n\\nAfter this taste of his quality, Captain Selover enjoyed a quiet ship.\\nWe made good time, but for a long while nothing happened. Finally the\\nmonotony was broken by an incident.\\n\\nOne evening before the night winds I sat in the shadow of the extra\\ndory on top of the deck house. The moon was but just beyond the full,\\nso I suppose I must have been practically invisible. Certainly the\\nNigger did not know of my presence, for he came and stood within three\\nfeet of me without giving any sign. The companion was open. In a\\nmoment some door below was opened also, and a scrap of conversation\\ncame up to us very clearly.\\n\\n\"You haf dem finished?\" the doctor\\'s voice inquired. \"So, that iss\\nwell,\"--papers rustled for a few moments. \"And the r-result--\\nah--exactly--it iss that exactly. Percy, mein son, that maigs\\nthe experiment exact. We haf the process----\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see, sir, quite,\" replied the voice of Percy Darrow, with\\na tinge of excitement. \"I can follow the logic of the experiment, of\\ncourse--so can I follow the logic of a trip to the moon. But when you\\ncome to apply it--how do you get your re-agent? There\\'s no known\\nmethod----\"\\n\\nDr. Schermerhorn broke in: \"Ach, it iss that I haf perfected. Pardon\\nme, my boy, it iss the first I haf worked from you apart. It iss for\\na surprise. I haf made in small quantities the missing ingredient.\\nIt will form a perfect interruption to the current. Now we go----\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say,\" almost shouted Darrow, \"that you have succeeded\\nin freeing it in the metal?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor simply.\\n\\nI could hear a chair overturned.\\n\\n\"Why, with that you can----\"\\n\\n\"I can do everything,\" broke in the doctor. \"The possibilities are\\nenormous.\"\\n\\n\"And you can really produce it in quantity?\"\\n\\n\"I think so; it iss for us to discover.\"\\n\\nA pause ensued.\\n\\n\"Why!\" came the voice of Percy Darrow, awestricken. \"With fifty\\ncentigrammes only you could--you could transmute any substance--why,\\nyou could make anything you pleased almost! You could make enough\\ndiamonds to fill that chest! It is the philosopher\\'s stone!\"\\n\\n\"Diamonds--yes--it is possible,\" interrupted the doctor impatiently,\\n\"if it was worth while. But you should see the real importance----\"\\n\\nThe ship careened to a chance swell; a door slammed; the voices were\\ncut off. I looked up. The Nigger\\'s head was thrust forward fairly into\\nthe glow from the companionway. The mask of his sullenness had fallen.\\nHis eyes fairly rolled in excitement, his thick lips were drawn back\\nto expose his teeth, his powerful figure was gathered with the tensity\\nof a bow. When the door slammed, he turned silently to glide away.\\nAt that instant the watch was changed, and in a moment I found myself\\nin my bunk.\\n\\nTen seconds later the Nigger, detained by Captain Selover for some\\ntrifling duty, burst into the forecastle. He was possessed by the\\nwildest excitement. This in itself was enough to gain the attention\\nof the men, but his first words were startling.\\n\\n\"I found de treasure!\" he almost shouted. \"I know where he kept!\"\\n\\nThey leaped at him--Handy Solomon and Pulz--and fairly shook out of\\nhim what he thought he knew. He babbled in the forgotten terms of\\nalchemy, dressing modern facts in the garments of mediaeval thought\\nuntil they were scarcely to be recognised.\\n\\n\"And so he say dat he fine him, de Philosopher Stone, and he keep him\\nin dat heavy box we see him carry aboard, and he don\\' have to make\\ngol\\' with it--he can make diamon\\'s--_diamon\\'s_--he say it too\\neasy to fill dat box plum full of diamon\\'s.\"\\n\\nThey gesticulated and exclaimed and breathed hard, full of the marvel\\nof such a thought. Then abruptly the clamour died to nothing. I felt\\nsix eyes bent on me, six unwinking eyes moving restless in motionless\\nfigures, suspicious, deadly as cobras----\\n\\nUp to now my standing with the men had been well enough. Now they drew\\nfrankly apart. One of the most significant indications of this was\\nthe increased respect they paid my office. It was as though by prompt\\nobedience, instant deference, and the emphasising of ship\\'s etiquette\\nthey intended to draw sharply the line between themselves and me.\\nThere was much whispering apart, many private talks and consultations\\nin which I had no part. Ordinarily they talked freely enough before\\nme. Even the reading during the dog watch was intermitted--at least\\nit was on such days as I happened to be in the watch below. But twice\\nI caught the Nigger and Handy Solomon consulting together over the\\nvolume on alchemy.\\n\\nI was in two minds whether to report the whole matter to Captain\\nSelover. The only thing that restrained me was the vagueness of the\\nintention, and the fact that the afterguard was armed, and was four\\nto the crew\\'s five. An incident, however, decided me. One evening I\\nwas awakened by a sound of violent voices. Captain Selover occasionally\\njuggled the watches for variety\\'s sake, and I now had Handy Solomon\\nand Perdosa. The Nigger, being cook, stood no watch.\\n\\n\"You drunken Greaser swab!\" snarled Handy Solomon. \"You misbegotten\\nson of a Yaqui! I\\'ll learn you to step on a seaman\\'s foot, and you\\ncan kiss the book on that! I\\'ll cut your heart out and feed it to the\\nsharks!\"\\n\\n\"Potha!\" sneered Perdosa. \"You cut heem you finger wid your knife.\"\\n\\nThey wrangled. At first I thought the quarrel genuine, but after a\\nmoment or so I could not avoid a sort of reminiscent impression of\\nthe cheap melodrama. It seemed incredible, but soon I could not dodge\\nthe conclusion that it was a made-up quarrel designed to impress me.\\n\\nWhy should they desire to do so? I had to give it up, but the fact\\nitself was obvious enough. I laughed to see them. The affair did not\\ncome to blows, but it did come to black looks on meeting, muttered\\noaths, growls of enmity every time they happened to pass each other\\non the deck. Perdosa was not so bad; his Mexican blood inclined him\\nto the histrionic, and his Mexican cast lent itself well to evil looks.\\nBut Handy Solomon, for the first time in my acquaintance with him,\\nwas ridiculous.\\n\\nAbout this time we crossed into frequent thunders. One evening just\\nat dark we made out a heavy black squall. Not knowing exactly what\\nweight lay behind it, I called up all hands. We ducked the staysail\\nand foresail, lowered the peak of the mainsail, and waited to feel\\nof it--a rough and ready seamanship often used in these little California\\nwindjammers. I was pretty busy, but I heard distinctly Handy Solomon\\'s\\nvoice behind me.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll kill you sure, you Greaser, as soon as my hands are free!\"\\n\\nAnd some muttered reply from the Mexican.\\n\\nThe wind hit us hard, held on a few moments, and moderated to a stiff\\npuff. There followed the rain, so of course I knew it would amount\\nto nothing. I was just stooping to throw the stops off the staysail\\nwhen I felt myself seized from behind, and forced rapidly toward the\\nside of the ship.\\n\\nOf course I struggled. The Japanese have a little trick to fool a man\\nwho catches you around the waist from behind. It is part of the\\njiu-jitsu taught the Samurai--quite a different proposition from the\\nordinary \"policeman jiu-jitsu.\" I picked it up from a friend in the\\nnobility. It came in very handy now, and by good luck a roll of the\\nship helped me. In a moment I stood free, and Perdosa was picking\\nhimself out of the scuppers.\\n\\nThe expression of astonishment was fairly well done--I will say that\\nfor him--but I was prepared for histrionics.\\n\\n\"Señor!\" he gasped. \"Eet is you! _Sacrosanta Maria!_ I thought\\nyou was dat Solomon! Pardon me, señor! Pardon! Have I hurt you?\"\\n\\nHe approached me almost wheedling. I could have laughed at the\\nvillain. It was all so transparent. He no more mistook me for Handy\\nSolomon than he felt any real enmity for that person. But being angry,\\nand perhaps a little scared, I beat him to his quarters with a\\nbelaying pin.\\n\\nOn thinking the matter over, however, I failed to see all the ins and\\nouts of it. I could understand a desire to get rid of me; there would\\nbe one less of the afterguard, and then, too, I knew too much of the\\nmen\\'s sentiments, if not of their plans. But why all this elaborate\\nfarce of the mock quarrel and the alleged mistake? Could it be to\\nguard against possible failure? I could hardly think it worth while.\\nMy only theory was that they had wished to test my strength and\\ndetermination. The whole affair, even on that supposition, was\\nchildish enough, but I referred the exaggerated cunning to Handy\\nSolomon, and considered it quite adequately explained. It is a minor\\npoint, but subsequently I learned that this surmise was correct. I\\nwas to be saved because none of the conspirators understood navigation.\\n\\nThe next morning I approached Captain Selover.\\n\\n\"Captain,\" said I, \"I think it my duty to report that there is trouble\\nbrewing among the crew.\"\\n\\n\"There always is,\" he replied, unmoved.\\n\\n\"But this is serious. Dr. Schermerhorn came aboard with a chest which\\nthe men think holds treasure. The other evening Robinson overheard\\nhim tell his assistant that he could easily fill the box with diamonds.\\nOf course, he was merely illustrating the value of some scientific\\nexperiment, but Robinson thinks, and has made the others think, that\\nthe chest contains something to make diamonds with. I am sure they\\nintend to get hold of it. The affair is coming to a head.\"\\n\\nCaptain Selover listened almost indifferently.\\n\\n\"I came back from the islands last year,\" he piped, \"with three\\nhundred thousand dollars\\' worth of pearls. There was sixteen in the\\ncrew, and every man of them was blood hungry for them pearls. They\\nhad three or four shindies and killed one man over the proper way to\\ndivide the loot after they had got it. They didn\\'t get it. Why?\" He\\ndrew his powerful figure to its height and spread his thick arms out\\nin the luxury of stretching. \"Why?\" he repeated, exhaling abruptly.\\n\"Because their captain was Ezra Selover! Well, Mr. Eagen,\" he went\\non crisply, \"Captain Ezra Selover is their captain, _and they know\\nit_! They\\'ll talk and palaver and git into dark corners, and\\nsharpen their knives, and perhaps fight it out as to which one\\'s going\\nto work the monkey-doodle business in the doctor\\'s chest, and which\\none\\'s going to tie up the sacks of them diamonds, but they won\\'t git\\nany farther as long as Captain Ezra is on deck.\" \"Yes,\" I objected,\\n\"but they mean business. Last night in the squall one of them tried\\nto throw me overboard.\"\\n\\nCaptain Selover grinned.\\n\\n\"What did you do?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Hazed him to his quarters with a belaying pin.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s all settled then, isn\\'t it? What more do you want?\"\\n\\nI stood undecided.\\n\\n\"I can take care of myself,\" he went on. \"You ought to take care of\\nyourself. Then there\\'s nothing more to do.\"\\n\\nHe mused a moment.\\n\\n\"You have a gun, of course?\" he inquired. \"I forgot to ask.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I.\\n\\nHe whistled.\\n\\n\"Well, no wonder you feel sort of lost and hopeless! Here, take this,\\nit\\'ll make a man of you.\"\\n\\nHe gave me a Colt\\'s 45, the barrel of which had been filed down to\\nabout two inches of length. It was a most extraordinary weapon, but\\neffective at short range.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a few loose cartridges,\" said he. \"Now go easy. This is no\\nwarship, and we ain\\'t got men to experiment on. Lick \\'em with your\\nfists or a pin, if you can; and if you do shoot, for God\\'s sake just\\nwing \\'em a little. They\\'re awful good lads, but a little restless.\"\\n\\nI took the gun and felt better. With it I could easily handle the\\nmembers of my own watch, and I did not doubt that with the assistance\\nof Percy Darrow even a surprise would hardly overwhelm us. I did not\\ncount on Dr. Schermerhorn. He was quite capable of losing himself in\\na problem of trajectory after the first shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nTHE ISLAND\\n\\n\\nI came on deck one morning at about four bells to find the entire\\nship\\'s company afoot. Even the doctor was there. Everybody was gazing\\neagerly at a narrow, mountainous island lying slate-coloured across\\nthe early morning.\\n\\nWe were as yet some twenty miles distant from it, and could make out\\nnothing but its general outline. The latter was sharply defined,\\nrising and falling to a highest point one side of the middle. Over\\nthe island, and raggedly clasping its sides, hung a cloud, the only\\none visible in the sky.\\n\\nI joined the afterguard.\\n\\n\"You see?\" the doctor was exclaiming. \"It iss as I haf said. The\\nisland iss there. Everything iss as it should be!\" He was quite\\nexcited.\\n\\nPercy Darrow, too, was shaken out of his ordinary calm.\\n\\n\"The volcano is active,\" was his only comment, but it explained the\\nragged cloud.\\n\\n\"You say there\\'s a harbour?\" inquired Captain Selover.\\n\\n\"It should be on the west end,\" said Dr. Schermerhorn.\\n\\nCaptain Selover drew me one side. He, too was a little aroused.\\n\\n\"Now wouldn\\'t that get you?\" he squeaked. \"Doctor runs up against a\\nNorwegian bum who tells him about a volcanic island, and gives its\\nbearings. The island ain\\'t on the map at all. Doctor believes it, and\\nmakes me lay my course for those bearings. _And here\\'s the\\nisland_! So the bum\\'s story was true! I\\'d like to know what the\\nrest of it was!\" His eyes were shining.\\n\\n\"Do we anchor or stand off and on?\" I asked.\\n\\nCaptain Selover turned to grip me by the shoulder.\\n\\n\"I have orders from Darrow to get to a good berth, to land, to build\\nshore quarters, and to snug down for a stay of a year at least!\"\\n\\nWe stared at each other.\\n\\n\"Joyous prospect,\" I muttered. \"Hope there\\'s something to do there.\"\\n\\nThe morning wore, and we rapidly approached the island. It proved to\\nbe utterly precipitous. The high rounded hills sloped easily to within\\na hundred feet or so of the water and then fell away abruptly. Where\\nthe earth ended was a fantastic filigree border, like the fancy paper\\nwith which our mothers used to line the pantry shelves. Below, the\\nwhite surges flung themselves against the cliffs with a wild abandon.\\nThousands of sea birds wheeled in the eddies of the wind, thousands\\nof ravens perched on the slopes. With our glasses we could make out\\nthe heads of seals fishing outside the surf, and a ragged belt of kelp.\\n\\nWhen within a mile we put the helm up, and ran for the west end. A\\nbold point we avoided far out, lest there should be outlying ledges.\\nThen we came in sight of a broad beach and pounding surf.\\n\\nI was ordered to take a surf boat and investigate for a landing and\\nan anchorage. The swell was running high. We rowed back and forth,\\npuzzled as to how to get ashore with all the freight it would be\\nnecessary to land. The ship would lie well enough, for the only open\\nexposure was broken by a long reef over which we could make out the\\nseas tumbling. But inshore the great waves rolled smoothly, swiftly--\\nthen suddenly fell forward as over a ledge, and spread with a roar\\nacross the yellow sands. The fresh winds blew the spume back to us.\\nWe conversed in shouts.\\n\\n\"We can surf the boat,\" yelled Thrackles, \"but we can\\'t land a load.\"\\n\\nThat was my opinion. We rowed slowly along, parallel to the shore,\\nand just outside the line of breakers. I don\\'t know exactly how to\\ntell you the manner in which we became aware of the cove. It was as\\nnearly the instantaneous as can be imagined. One minute I looked ahead\\non a cliff as unbroken as the side of a cabin; the very next I peered\\ndown the length of a cove fifty fathoms long by about ten wide, at\\nthe end of which was a gravel beach. I cried out sharply to the men.\\nThey were quite as much astonished as I. We backed water, watching\\nclosely. At a given point the cove and all trace of its entrance\\ndisappeared. We could only just make out the line where the headlands\\ndissolved into the background of the cliffs, and that merely because\\nwe knew of its existence. The blending was perfect.\\n\\nWe rowed in. The water was still. A faint ebb and flow whispered\\nagainst the tiny gravel beach at the end. I noted a practicable way\\nfrom it to the top of the cliff, and from the cliff down again to the\\nsand beach. Everything was perfect. The water was a beautiful light\\ngreen, like semi-opaque glass, and from the indistinctness of its\\ndepths waved and beckoned, rose and disappeared with indescribable\\ngrace and deliberation long feathery sea growths. In a moment the\\nbottom abruptly shallowed. The motion of the boat toward the beach\\npermitted us to catch a hasty glimpse of little fish darting, of big\\nfish turning, of yellow sand and some vivid colour. Then came the\\ngrate of gravel and the scraping of the boat\\'s bottom on the beach.\\nWe jumped ashore eagerly. I left the men, very reluctant, and ascended\\na natural trail to a high sloping down over which blew the great Trades.\\nGrass sprung knee-high. A low hill rose at the back. From below the\\nfall of the cliff came the pounding of surf.\\n\\nI walked to the edge. Various ledges, sloping toward me, ran down to\\nthe sea. Against one of them was a wreck, not so very old, head on,\\nher afterworks gone. I recognised the name _Golden Horn_, and\\nwas vastly astonished to find her here against this unknown island.\\nFar up the coast I could see--with the surges dashing up like the explosion\\nof shells, and the cliffs, and the rampart of hills grown with grass\\nand cactus. A bold promontory terminated the coast view to the north,\\nand behind it I could glimpse a more fertile and wooded country. The\\nsky was partly overcast by the volcanic murk. It fled before the\\nTrades, and the red sun alternately blazed and clouded through it.\\n\\nAs there was nothing more to be seen here, I turned above the hollow\\nof our cove, skirted the base of the hill, and so down to the beach.\\n\\nIt occupied a wide semicircle where the hills drew back. The flat was\\ndry and grown with thick, coarse grass. A stream emerged from a sort\\nof canon on its landward side. I tasted it, found it sulphurous, and\\na trifle worse than lukewarm. A little nearer the cliff, however, was\\na clear, cold spring from the rock, and of this I had a satisfying\\ndrink. When I arose from my knees, I made out an animal on the hill\\ncrest looking at me, but before I could distinguish its\\ncharacteristics it had disappeared.\\n\\nI returned along the tide sands. The surf dashed and roared, lifting\\nseaweeds of a blood red, so that in places the water looked pink.\\nSeals innumerable watched me from just outside the breakers. As the\\nwaves lifted to a semi-transparence, I could make out others playing,\\ndarting back and forth, up and down like disturbed tadpoles, clinging\\nto the wave until the very instant of its fall, then disappearing as\\nthough blotted out. The salt smell of seaweed was in my nostrils: I\\nfound the place pleasant--\\n\\nWith these few and scattered impressions we returned to the ship. It\\nhad been warped to a secure anchorage, and snugged down. Dr.\\nSchermerhorn and Darrow were on deck waiting to go ashore.\\n\\nI made my report. The two passengers disappeared. They carried lunch\\nand would not be back until night-fall. We had orders to pitch a large\\ntent at a suitable spot and to lighten ship of the doctor\\'s personal\\nand scientific effects. By the time this was accomplished, the two\\nhad returned.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" Darrow volunteered to Captain Selover, as he came\\nover the side. \"We\\'ve found what we want.\"\\n\\nTheir clothes were picked by brush and their boots muddy. Next morning\\nCaptain Selover detailed me to especial work.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll take two of the men and go ashore under Darrow\\'s orders,\" said\\nhe.\\n\\nDarrow told us to take clothes for a week, an axe apiece, and a block\\nand tackle. We made up our ditty bags, stepped into one of the surf\\nboats, and were rowed ashore. There Darrow at once took the lead.\\n\\nOur way proceeded across the grass flat, through the opening of the\\nnarrow cañon, and so on back into the interior by way of the bed\\nthrough which flowed the sulphur stream. The country was badly eroded.\\nMost of the time we marched between perpendicular clay banks about\\nforty feet high. These were occasionally broken by smaller tributary\\narroyos of the same sort. It would have been impossible to reach the\\nlevel of the upper country. The bed of the main arroyo was flat, and\\ngrown with grasses and herbage of an extraordinary vividness, due,\\nI supposed, to the sulphur water. The stream itself meandered aimlessly\\nthrough the broader bed. It steadily grew warmer and the sulphur smell\\nmore noticeable. Above us we could see the sky and the sharp clay edge\\nof the arroyo. I noticed the tracks of Darrow and Dr. Schermerhorn\\nmade the day before.\\n\\nAfter a mile of this, the bottom ran up nearly to the level of the\\nsides, and we stepped out on the floor of a little valley almost\\nsurrounded by more hills.\\n\\nIt was an extraordinary place, and since much happened there, I must\\ngive you an idea of it.\\n\\nIt was round and nearly encircled by naked painted hills. From its\\nfloor came steam and a roaring sound. The steam blew here and\\nthere among the pines on the floor; rose to eddy about the naked\\npainted hills. At one end we saw intermittently a broad ascending\\ncañon--deep red and blue-black--ending in the cone of a smoking\\nvolcano. The other seemed quite closed by the sheer hills; in fact\\nthe only exit was the route by which we had come.\\n\\nFor the hills were utterly precipitous. I suppose a man might have\\nmade his way up the various knobs, ledges, and inequalities, but it\\nwould have required long study and a careful head. I, myself, later\\nworked my way a short distance, merely to examine the texture of their\\nmarvellous colour.\\n\\nThis was at once varied and of great body--not at all like the smooth,\\nglossed colour of most rock, but soft and rich. You\\'ve seen painters\\'\\npalettes--it was just like that, pasty and _fat_. There were reds\\nof all shades, from a veritable scarlet to a red umber; greens, from\\nsea-green to emerald; several kinds of blue, and an indeterminate\\npurple-mauve. The whole effect was splendid and barbaric.\\n\\nWe stopped and gasped as it hit our eyes. Darrow alone was unmoved.\\nHe led the way forward and in an instant had disappeared behind the\\nveil of steam. Thrackles and Perdosa hung back murmuring, but at a\\nsharp word from me gathered their courage in their two hands and proceeded.\\n\\nWe found that the first veil of steam, and a fearful stench of gases,\\nproceeded from a miniature crater whose edge was heavily encrusted\\nwith a white salt. Beyond, close under the rise of the hill, was\\nanother. Between the two Percy Darrow had stopped and was waiting.\\n\\nHe eyed us with his lazy, half-quizzical glance as we approached.\\n\\n\"Think the place is going to blow up?\" he inquired, with a tinge of\\nirony. \"Well, it isn\\'t.\" He turned to me. \"Here\\'s where we shall stay\\nfor a while. You and the men are to cut a number of these pine trees\\nfor a house. Better pick out the little ones, about three or four\\ninches through: they\\'re easier handled. I\\'ll be back by noon.\"\\n\\nWe set to work then in the roaring, steaming valley with the vapour\\nswirling about us, sometimes concealing us, sometimes half revealing\\nus gigantic, again in the utterness of exposure showing us dwindled\\npigmies against the magnitudes about us. The labour was not difficult.\\nBy the time Darrow returned we had a pile of the saplings ready for\\nhis next direction.\\n\\nHe was accompanied by the Nigger, very much terrified, very much\\nburdened with food and cooking utensils. The assistant was lazily\\nrelating tales of voodoos, a glimmer of mischief in his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nCAPTAIN SELOVER LOSES HIS NERVE\\n\\n\\nI lived in the place for three weeks. We were afoot shortly after\\ndaybreak, under way by sun-up, and at work before the heats began.\\nThree of us worked on the buildings, and the rest formed a pack train\\ncarrying all sorts of things from the shore to the valley. The men\\ngrumbled fiercely at this, but Captain Selover drove them with slight\\nregard for their opinions or feelings.\\n\\n\"You\\'re getting double pay,\" was his only word, \"earn it!\"\\n\\nThey certainly earned it during those three weeks. The things they\\nbrought up were astounding. Besides a lot of scientific apparatus and\\nchests of chemical supplies, everything that could possibly be\\nrequired, had been provided by that omniscient young man. After we\\nhad built a long, low structure, windows were forthcoming, shelves,\\ntables, sinks, faucets, forges, burners, all cut out, fitted and ready\\nto put together, each with its proper screws, nails, clamps, or pipes\\nready to our hands. When we had finished, we had constructed as\\ncomplete a laboratory on a small scale as you could find on a college\\ncampus, even to the stone pillar down to bed-rock for delicate\\nmicroscopic experiments, and hot and cold water led from the springs.\\nAnd we were utterly unskilled. It was all Percy Darrow.\\n\\nI was toward the last engaged in screwing on a fixture for the\\ngeneration of acetelyne gas.\\n\\n\"Darrow,\" said I, \"there\\'s one thing you\\'ve overlooked; you forgot\\nto bring a cupola and a gilt weather-cock for this concern.\"\\n\\nAfter the laboratory was completed, we put up sleeping quarters for\\nthe two men, with wide porches well screened, and a square, heavy\\nstoreroom. By the end of the third week we had quite finished.\\n\\nDr. Schermerhorn had turned with enthusiasm to the unpacking of his\\nchemical apparatus. Almost immediately at the close of the\\nfreight-carrying, he had appeared, lugging his precious chest, this\\ntime suffering the assistance of Darrow, and had camped on the spot.\\nWe could not induce him to leave, so we put up a tent for him. Darrow\\nremained with him by way of safety against the men, whose measure,\\nI believe, he had taken. Now that all the work was finished, the doctor\\nput in a sudden appearance.\\n\\n\"Percy,\" said he, \"now we will have the defence built.\"\\n\\n\\nHe dragged us with him to the narrow part of the arroyo, just before\\nit rose to the level of the valley.\\n\\n\"Here we will build the stockade-defence,\" he announced.\\n\\nDarrow and I stared at each other blankly.\\n\\n\"What for, sir?\" inquired the assistant.\\n\\n\"I haf come to be undisturbed,\" announced the doctor, with owl-like,\\nTeutonic gravity, \"and I will not be disturbed.\"\\n\\nDarrow nodded to me and drew his principal aside.\\n\\nThey conversed earnestly for several minutes. Then the assistant\\nreturned to me.\\n\\n\"No use,\" he shrugged in complete return to his indifferent manner.\\n\"Stockade it is. Better make it of fourteen foot logs, slanted out.\\nDig a trench across, plant your logs three or four feet, bind them\\nat the top. That\\'s his specification for it. Go at it.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" I expostulated, \"what\\'s the _use_ of it? Even if the men\\nwere dangerous, that would just make them think you _did_ have\\nsomething to guard.\"\\n\\n\"I know that. Orders,\" replied Percy Darrow.\\n\\nWe built the stockade in a day. When it was finished we marched to\\nthe beach, and never, save in the three instances of which I shall\\nlater tell you, did I see the valley again. The next day we washed\\nour clothes, and moved ashore with all our belongings.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to have this crew aboard,\" stated Captain Selover\\npositively, \"I\\'m going to clean her.\" He himself stayed, however.\\n\\nWe rowed in, constructed a hasty fireplace of stones, spread our\\nblankets, and built an unnecessary fire near the beach.\\n\\n\"Clean her!\" grumbled Thrackles, \"my eye!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather round the Cape,\" growled Pulz hopelessly.\\n\\n\"Come, now, it can\\'t be as bad as all that,\" I tried to cheer them.\\n\"It can\\'t be more than a week or ten days\\' job, even if we careen her.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about,\" said Thrackles. \"It\\'s\\nworse than the yellow jack. It\\'s six weeks at least. Mind when we last\\n\\'cleaned her\\'?\" he inquired of Handy Solomon.\\n\\n\"You can kiss the Book on it,\" replied he. \"Down by the line in that\\nlittle swab of a sand island. My eye, but _don\\'t_ I remember!\\nI sweated my liver white.\"\\n\\nThey smoked in silence.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a main queer contrivance of the Perfessor\\'s--that\\nstockade-like,\" ventured Solomon, after a little.\\n\\n\"He doesn\\'t want any intrusion,\" I said. \"These scientific experiments\\nare very delicate.\"\\n\\n\"Quite like,\" he commented non-committally.\\n\\nWe slept on the ground that night, and next morning, under Captain\\nSelover\\'s directions, we commenced the task of lightening the ship.\\nHe detailed the Nigger and Perdosa for special duty.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just see to your shore quarters,\" he squeaked. \"You empty her.\"\\n\\nAll day long we rowed back and forth from the ship to the cove,\\nlanding the contents of the hold. These, by good fortune, we did not\\nhave to carry over the neck of land, for just above the gravel beach\\nwas a wide ledge on which we could pile the stores. We ate aboard,\\nand so had no opportunity of seeing what Captain Selover and his men\\nwere about, until evening. Then we discovered that they had collected\\nand lowered to the beach a quantity of stateroom doors from the wreck,\\nand had trundled the galley stove to the edge where it awaited our\\nassistance. We hitched a cable to it, and let it down gently. The\\nNigger was immensely pleased. After some experiment he got it to draw,\\nand so cooked us our supper on it. After supper, Captain Selover rowed\\nhimself back to the ship.\\n\\n\\n\"Eagen,\" he had said, drawing me aside, \"I\\'m going to leave you with\\nthem. It\\'s better that one of us--I think as owner I ought to be\\naboard----\"\\n\\n\"Of course, sir,\" said I, \"it\\'s the only proper place for you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you think so,\" he rejoined, apparently relieved. \"And\\nanyway,\" he cried, with a burst of feeling, \"I hate the gritty feeling\\nof it under my feet! Solid oak\\'s the only walking for a man.\"\\n\\nHe left me hastily, as though a trifle ashamed. I thought he seemed\\ndepressed, even a little furtive, and yet on analysis I could discover\\nnothing definite on which to base such a conclusion.\\n\\nIt was rather a feeling of difference from the man I had known. In\\nmy fatigue it seemed hardly worth thinking about.\\n\\nThe men had rolled themselves in their blankets, tired with the long\\nday.\\n\\nNext morning Captain Selover was ashore early. He had quite recovered\\nhis spirits, and offered me a dram of French brandy, which I refused.\\nWe worked hard again; again the master returned at night to his\\nvessel, this time without a word to any of us; again the men, drugged\\nby toil, turned in early and slept like the dead.\\n\\nWe became entangled in a mesh of days like these, during which things\\nwere accomplished, but in which was no space for anything but the\\ntasks imposed upon us. The men for the most part had little to say.\\n\\n\"Por Dios, eet is too mooch work!\" sighed Perdosa once.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you kick to the Old Man, then?\" sneered Thrackles.\\n\\nThe silence that followed, and the sullenness with which Perdosa\\nreaddressed himself to his work, was significant enough of Captain\\nSelover\\'s past relations with the men.\\n\\nAnd how we did clean her! We stripped her of every stitch and sliver\\nuntil she floated high, an empty hull, even her spars and running\\nrigging ashore. I understood now the crew\\'s grumbling. We literally\\nwent at her with a nail brush.\\n\\nCaptain Selover took charge of us when we had reached this period.\\nHe and the Nigger and Perdosa had long since finished the installation\\nof the permanent camp. They had built us huts from the wreck, collecting\\nstateroom doors for the sides, and hatches for the roofs, huge and\\nsolid, with iron rings in them. The bronze and iron ventilation\\ngratings to the doors gave us glimpses of the coast through fretwork;\\nthe rich inlaying of woods surrounded us. We set up on a solid rock\\nthe galley stove--with its rails to hold the cooking pots from\\nupsetting, in a sea way. In it we burned the débris of the wreck, all\\nsorts of wood, some sweet and aromatic and spicy as an incensed\\ncathedral. I have seen the Nigger boiling beans over a blaze of sandal\\nwood fragrant as an Eastern shop.\\n\\nFirst we scrubbed the _Laughing Lass_, then we painted her, and\\nresized and tarred her standing rigging, resized and rove her running\\ngear, slushed her masts, finally careened her and scraped and painted\\nher below.\\n\\nWhen we had quite finished, we had the anchor chain dealt out to us\\nin fathoms, and scraped, pounded and polished that. These were indeed\\ndays full of labour.\\n\\nBeing busy from morning until night we knew but little of what was\\nabout us. We saw the open sea and the waves tumbling over the reef\\noutside. We saw the headlands, and the bow of the bay and the surf\\nwith its watching seals and the curve of yellow sands. We saw the\\nsweep of coast and the downs and the strange huts we had built out\\nof departed magnificence. And that was all; that constituted our world.\\n\\nIn the evening sometimes we lit a big bonfire, sailor fashion, just\\nat the edge of the beach. There we sat at ease and smoked our pipes\\nin silence, too tired to talk. Even Handy Solomon\\'s song was still.\\nOutside the circle of light were mysterious things--strange wavings\\nof white hands, bendings of figures, callings of voices, rustling of\\nfeet. We knew them for the surf and the wind in the grasses: but they\\nwere not the less mysterious for that.\\n\\nLogically Captain Selover and I should have passed most of our\\nevenings together. As a matter of fact we so spent very few. Early\\nin the dusk the captain invariably rowed himself out to his beloved\\nschooner. What he did there I do not know. We could see his light now\\nin one part of her, now in the other. The men claimed he was scrubbing\\nher teeth. \"Old Scrubs\" they called him to his back: never Captain\\nSelover.\\n\\n\"He has to clean up after his own feet, he\\'s so dirty,\" sagely\\nproffered Handy Solomon. And this was true.\\n\\nThe seaman\\'s prophecy held good. Seven weeks held us at that infernal\\njob--seven weeks of solid, grinding work. The worst of it was, that\\nwe were kept at it so breathlessly, as though our very existence were\\nto depend on the headlong rush of our labour. And then we had fully\\nhalf the stores to put away again, and the other half to transport\\npainfully over the neck of land from the cove to the beach.\\n\\nSo accustomed had I become to the routine in which we were involved,\\nso habituated to anticipating the coming day as exactly like the day\\nthat had gone, that the completion of our job caught me quite by\\nsurprise. I had thrown myself down by the fire prepared for the some\\nold half hour of drowsy nicotine, to be followed by the accustomed\\nheavy sleep, and the usual early rising to toil. The evening was warm;\\nI half closed my eyes.\\n\\nHandy Solomon was coming in last. Instead of dropping to his place,\\nhe straddled the fire, stretching his arms over his head. He let them\\nfall with a sharp exhalation.\\n\\n \"\\'Lay aloft, lay aloft,\\' the jolly bos\\'n cried.\\n     _Blow high, blow low, what care we!_\\n  \\'Look ahead, look astern, look a-windward, look a-lee.\\'\\n     _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e._\"\\n\\nThe effect was electrical. We all sprang to our feet and fell to\\ntalking at once.\\n\\n\"By God, we\\'re _through_!\" cried Pulz. \"I\\'d clean forgot it!\"\\n\\nThe Nigger piled on more wood. We drew closer about the fire. All the\\ninterests in life, so long held in the background, leaped forward,\\neager for recognition. We spoke of trivialities almost for the first\\ntime since our landing, fused into a temporary but complete good\\nfellowship by the relief.\\n\\n\"Wonder how the old doctor is getting on?\" ventured Thrackles, after\\na while.\\n\\n\"The devil\\'s a preacher! I wonder?\" cried Handy Solomon.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s make \\'em a call,\" suggested Pulz.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t believe they\\'d appreciate the compliment,\" I laughed. \"Better\\nlet them make first call: they\\'re the longer established.\" This was\\nlost on them, of course. But we all felt kindly to one another that\\nevening.\\n\\nI carried the glow of it with me over until next morning, and was\\ntherefore somewhat dashed to meet Captain Selover, with clouded brows\\nand an uncertain manner. He quite ignored my greeting.\\n\\n\"By God, Eagen,\" he squeaked, \"can you think of anything more to be\\ndone?\"\\n\\nI straightened my back and laughed.\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t you worked us hard enough?\" I inquired. \"Unless you gild the\\ncabins, I don\\'t see what else there can be to do.\"\\n\\nCaptain Selover stared me over.\\n\\n\"And you a naval man!\" he marvelled. \"Don\\'t you see that the only\\nthing that keeps this crew from gettin\\' restless is keeping them busy?\\nI\\'ve sweat a damn sight more with my brain than you have with your\\nback thinking up things to do. I can\\'t see anything ahead, and then\\nwe\\'ll have hell to pay. Oh, they\\'re a sweet lot!\"\\n\\nI whistled and my crest fell. Here was a new point of view; and also\\na new Captain Ezra. Where was the confidence in the might of his two\\nhands?\\n\\nHe seemed to read my thoughts, and went on.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t feel _sure_ here on this cussed land. It ain\\'t like a\\ndeck where a man has some show. They can scatter. They can hide. It\\nain\\'t right to put a man ashore alone with such a crew. I\\'m doing my\\nbest, but it ain\\'t goin\\' to be good enough. I wisht we were safe in\\n\\'Frisco harbour----\"\\n\\nHe would have maundered on, but I seized his arm and led him out of\\npossible hearing of the men.\\n\\n\"Here, buck up!\" I said to him sternly. \"There\\'s nothing to be scared\\nof. If it comes to a row, there\\'s three of us and we\\'ve got guns. We\\ncould even sail the schooner at a pinch, and leave them here. You\\'ve\\nstood them off before.\"\\n\\n\"Not ashore,\" protested Captain Selover weakly.\\n\\n\"Well, they don\\'t know that. For God\\'s sake don\\'t let them see you\\'ve\\nlost your nerve this way.\" He did not even wince at the accusation.\\n\"Put up a front.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head. The sand had completely run out of him. Yet I am\\nconvinced that if he could have felt the heave and roll of the deck\\nbeneath him, he would have faced three times the difficulties he now\\nfeared. However, I could see readily enough the wisdom of keeping the\\nmen at work.\\n\\n\"You can wreck the _Golden Horn_,\" I suggested. \"I don\\'t know\\nwhether there\\'s anything left worth salvage; but it\\'ll be something\\nto do.\"\\n\\nHe clapped me on the shoulder.\\n\\n\"Good!\" he cried, \"I never thought of it.\"\\n\\n\"Another thing,\" said I, \"you better give them a day off a week. That\\ncan\\'t hurt them and it\\'ll waste just that much more time.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" agreed Captain Selover.\\n\\n\"Another thing yet. You know I\\'m not lazy, so it ain\\'t that I\\'m trying\\nto dodge work. But you\\'d better lay me off. It\\'ll be so much more for\\nthe others.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true,\" said he.\\n\\n\\n\\nI could not recognise the man for what I knew him to be. He groped,\\nas one in the dark, or as a sea animal taken out of its element and\\nplaced on the sands. Courage had given place to fear; decision to\\nwavering; and singleness of purpose to a divided counsel. He who had\\nso thoroughly dominated the entire ship, eagerly accepted advice of\\nme--a man without experience.\\n\\nThat evening I sat apart considerably disturbed. I felt that the\\nground had dropped away beneath my feet. To be sure, everything was\\ntranquil at present; but now I understood the source of that\\ntranquillity and how soon it must fail. With opportunity would come\\nmore scheming, more speculation, more cupidity. How was I to meet it,\\nwith none to back me but a scared man, an absorbed man, and an\\nindifferent man?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nWRECKING OF THE GOLDEN HORN\\n\\n\\nPercy Darrow, unexpected, made his first visit to us the very next\\nevening. He sauntered in with a Mexican corn-husk cigarette between\\nhis lips, carrying a lantern; blew the light out, and sat down with\\na careless greeting, as though he had seen us only the day before.\\n\\n\"Hullo, boys,\" said he, \"been busy?\"\\n\\n\"How are ye, sir?\" replied Handy Solomon. \"Good Lord, mates, look at\\nthat!\"\\n\\nOur eyes followed the direction of his forefinger. Against the dark\\nblue of the evening sky to northward glowed a faint phosphorescence,\\narch-shaped, from which shot, with pulsating regularity, long shafts\\nof light. They beat almost to the zenith, and back again, a half dozen\\ntimes, then the whole illumination disappeared with the suddenness\\nof gas turned out.\\n\\n\"Now I wonder what that might be!\" marvelled Thrackles.\\n\\n\"Northern lights,\" hazarded Pulz. \"I\\'ve seen them almost like that\\nin the Behring Seas.\"\\n\\n\"Northern lights your eye!\" sneered Handy Solomon. \"You may have seen\\nthem in the Behring Seas, but never this far south, and in August,\\nand you can, kiss the Book on that.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think, sir?\" Thrackles inquired of the assistant.\\n\\n\"Devil\\'s fire,\" replied Percy Darrow briefly. \"The island\\'s a little\\nqueer. I\\'ve noticed it before.\"\\n\\n\"Debbil fire,\" repeated the Nigger.\\n\\nDarrow turned directly to him.\\n\\n\"Yes, devil\\'s fire; and devils, too, for all I know; and certainly\\nvampires. Did you ever hear of vampires, Doctor?\"\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" growled the Nigger.\\n\\n\"Well, they are women, wonderful, beautiful women. A man on a long\\nvoyage would just smack his lips to see them. They have shiny grey\\neyes, and lips red as raspberries. When you meet them they will talk\\nwith you and go home with you. And then when you\\'re asleep they tear\\na little hole in your neck with their sharp claws, and they suck the\\nblood with their red lips. When they aren\\'t women, they take the shape\\nof big bats like birds.\" He turned to me with so beautifully casual\\nan air that I wanted to clap him on the back with the joy of it.\\n\\n\"By the way, Eagen, have you noticed those big bats the last few\\nevenings, over by the cliff? _I_ can\\'t make out in the dusk\\nwhether they are vampires or just plain bats.\" He directed his remarks\\nagain to the Nigger. \"Next time you see any of those big bats, Doctor,\\njust you notice close. If they have just plain, black eyes, they\\'re\\nall right; but if they have grey eyes, with red rims around \\'em,\\nthey\\'re vampires. I wish you\\'d let me know, if you do find out. It\\'s\\ninteresting.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\' get me near no bats,\" growled the Nigger.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Selover?\" inquired Darrow.\\n\\n\"He stays aboard,\" I hastened to say. \"Wants to keep an eye on the\\nship.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s laudable. What have you been doing?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been cleaning ship. Just finished yesterday evening.\"\\n\\n\"What next?\"\\n\\n\"We were thinking of wrecking the _Golden Horn_.\"\\n\\n\"Quite right. Well, if you want any help with your engines or anything\\nof the sort, call on me.\"\\n\\n\\nHe arose and began to light his lantern. \"I hope as how you\\'re getting\\non well there above, sir?\" ventured Handy Solomon insinuatingly.\\n\\n\"Very well, I thank you, my man,\" replied Percy Darrow drily.\\n\"Remember those vampires, Doctor.\"\\n\\nHe swung the lantern and departed without further speech. We followed\\nthe spark of it until it disappeared in the arroyo.\\n\\nBehind us bellowed the sea; over against us in the sky was the dull\\nthreatening glow of the volcano; about us were mysterious noises of\\ncrying birds, barking seals, rustling or rushing winds. I felt the\\nthronging ghosts of all the old world\\'s superstition swirling madly\\nbehind us in the eddies that twisted the smoke of our fire.\\n\\nWe wrecked the _Golden Horn_. Forward was a rusted-out donkey\\nengine, which we took to pieces and put together again. It was no mean\\njob, for all the running parts had to be cleaned smooth, and with the\\nexception of a rudimentary knowledge on the part of Pulz and Perdosa,\\nwe were ignorant. In fact we should not have succeeded at all had it\\nnot been for Percy Darrow and his lantern. The first evening we took\\nhim over to the cliff\\'s edge he laughed aloud.\\n\\n\"Jove, boys, how could you guess it _all_ wrong,\" he wondered.\\n\\nWith a few brief words he set us right, Pulz, Perdosa, and I listening\\nintently; the others indifferent in the hopelessness of being able\\nto comprehend. Of course, we went wrong again in our next day\\'s\\nexperiments; but Darrow was down two or three times a week, and\\ngradually we edged toward a practical result.\\n\\nHis explanations consumed but a few moments. After they were finished,\\nwe adjourned to the fire.\\n\\nThus we came gradually to a better acquaintance with the doctor\\'s\\nassistant. In many respects he remained always a puzzle, to me.\\nCertainly the men never knew how to take him. He was evidently not\\nonly unafraid of them, but genuinely indifferent to them.\\n\\nYet he displayed a certain interest in their needs and affairs. His\\npractical knowledge was enormous. I think I have told you of the\\ncompleteness of his arrangements--everything had been foreseen from\\ngrindstones to gas nippers. The same quality of concrete speculation\\nshowed him what we lacked in our own lives.\\n\\nThere was, as you remember, the matter of Handy Solomon\\'s steel claw.\\nHe showed Thrackles a kind of lanyard knot that deep-sea person had\\nnever used. He taught Captain Selover how to make soft soap out of\\none species of seaweed. Me, he initiated in the art of fishing with\\na white bone lure. Our camp itself he reconstructed on scientific lines\\nso that we enjoyed less aromatic smoke and more palatable dinner. And\\nall of it he did amusedly, as though his ideas were almost too obvious\\nto need communication.\\n\\nWe became in a manner intimate with him. He guyed the men in his\\nindolent fashion, playing on their credulity, their good nature, even\\ntheir forbearance. They alternately grinned and scowled. He left\\nalways a confused impression, so that no one really knew whether he\\ncherished rancour against Percy Darrow or kindly feeling.\\n\\n\\nThe Nigger was Darrow\\'s especial prey. The assistant had early\\ndiscovered that the cook was given to signs, omens, and superstitions.\\n\\nFrom a curious scholar\\'s lore he drew fantastics with which to torment\\nhis victim. We heard of all the witches, warlocks, incubi, succibi,\\nharpies, devils, imps, and haunters of Avitchi, from all the teachings\\nof history, sacred and profane, Hindu, Egyptian, Greek, mediaeval,\\nSwedenborg, Rosicrucian, theosophy, theology, with every last ounce\\nof horror, mystery, shivers, and creeps squeezed out of them. They\\nwere gorgeous ghost stories, for they were told by a man fully informed\\nas to all the legendary and gruesome details. At first I used to think\\nhe might have communicated it more effectively. Then I saw that the\\ncool, drawling manner, the level voice, were in reality the highest\\nart. He told his stories in a half-amused, detached manner which imposed\\nconfidence more readily than any amount of earnest asseveration. The\\nmere fact of his own belief in what he said came to matter little.\\nHe was the vehicle by which was brought accurate knowledge. He had\\nread all these things, and now reported them as he had read: each man\\ncould decide for himself as to their credibility.\\n\\nAt last the donkey engine was cleared and reinstalled, atop the cliff.\\nThe Nigger built under her a fire of black walnut; Captain Selover\\nhanded out grog all around; and we started her up with a cheer, just\\nto see the wheels revolve.\\n\\nNext we half buried some long hatches, end up, to serve as bitts for\\nthe lines, hitched our cables to them, and joyfully commenced the task\\nof pulling the _Golden Horn_ piece by piece up the side of the\\ncliff.\\n\\nThe stores were badly damaged by the wet, and there was no liquor,\\nfor which I was sincerely grateful. We broke into the boxes, and arrayed\\nourselves in various garments--which speedily fell to pieces--and\\nappropriated gim-cracks of all sorts. There were some arms, but the\\nammunition had gone bad. Perdosa, out of forty or fifty mis-fires,\\ngot one feeble sputter, and a tremendous _bang_ which blew up\\nhis piece, leaving only the stock in his hand. A few tinned goods were\\nedible; but all the rest was destroyed. A lot of hard woods, a\\nthousand feet of chain cable, and a fairly good anchor might be\\nconsidered as prizes. As for the rest, it was foolishness, but we\\nhauled it up just the same until nothing at all remained. Then we shut\\noff the donkey engine, and put on dry clothes. We had been quite happy\\nfor the eight months.\\n\\nIt was now well along toward spring. The winter had been like summer,\\nand with the exception of a few rains of a week or so, we had enjoyed\\nbeautiful skies. The seals had thinned out considerably, but were now\\nreturning in vast numbers ready for their annual domestic\\narrangements.\\n\\n\\nOur Sundays we had mostly spent in resting, or in fishing. There were\\nmany deep sea fish to be had, of great palatability, but small\\ngameness; they came like so many leaden weights. A few of us had\\nclimbed some of the hills in a half-hearted curiosity, but from their\\nsummits saw nothing to tempt weariness. Practically we knew nothing\\nbeyond the mile or so of beach on which we lived.\\n\\nCaptain Selover had made a habit of coming ashore at least once during\\nthe day. He had contented himself with standing aloof, but I took\\npains to seem to confer with him, so that the men might suppose that\\nI, as mate, was engaged in carrying out his directions. The dread of\\nhim was my most potent influence over them.\\n\\nDuring the last few days of our wrecking, Captain Selover had omitted\\nhis daily visit. The fact made me uneasy, so that at my first\\nopportunity I sculled myself out to the schooner. I found him,\\nmoist-eyed as usual, leaning against the mainmast doing nothing.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve finished, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\\nHe looked at me.\\n\\n\"Will you come ashore and have a look, sir?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t going ashore again,\" he muttered thickly.\\n\\n\"What!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t going ashore again,\" he repeated obstinately, \"and that\\'s\\nall there is to it. It\\'s too much of a strain on any man. Suit yourself.\\nYou run them. I shipped as captain of a vessel. I\\'m no dock walloper.\\nI won\\'t _do_ it--for no man!\"\\n\\nI gasped with dismay at the man\\'s complete moral collapse. It seemed\\nincredible. I caught myself wondering whether he would recover tone\\nwere he again to put to sea.\\n\\n\"My God, man, but you _must_!\" I cried at last.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t, and that\\'s flat,\" said he, and turned deliberately on his\\nheel and disappeared in the cabin.\\n\\nI went ashore thoughtful and a little scared. But on reflection I\\nregained a great part of my ease of mind. You see, I had been with\\nthese men now eight months, during which they had been as orderly as\\nso many primary schoolboys. They had worked hard, without grumbling,\\nand had even approached a sort of friendliness about the camp fire.\\nMy first impression was overlaid. As I looked back on the voyage, with\\nwhat I took to be a clearer vision, I could not but admit that the\\nincidents were in themselves trivial enough--a natural excitement by\\na superstitious negro, a little tall talk that meant nothing. It must\\nhave been the glamour of the adventure that had deceived me; that,\\nand the unusual stage setting and costuming. Certainly few men would\\nwork hard for eight months without a murmur, without a chance to look\\nabout them.\\n\\nIn that, of course, I was deceived by my inexperience. I realised\\nlater the wonderful effect Captain Selover threw away with his empty\\nbrandy bottles. The crew might grumble and plot during the watch\\nbelow; but when Captain Ezra Selover said _work_, they worked.\\nHe had been saying work, for eight months. They had, from force of\\nexperience, obeyed him. It was all very simple.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nTHE EMPTY BRANDY BOTTLE\\n\\n\\nSo there I was at once deprived of my chief support. Although no\\ndanger seemed imminent, nevertheless the necessity of acting on my\\nown initiative and responsibility oppressed me somewhat.\\n\\nTruth to tell, after the first, I was more relieved than dismayed at\\nthe captain\\'s resolution to stay aboard. His drinking habit was\\ngrowing on him, and afloat or ashore he was now little more than a\\nfigurehead, so that my chief asset as far as he was concerned, was\\nrather his reputation than his direct influence. In contact with the\\nmen, I dreaded lest sooner or later he do something to lessen or\\ndestroy the awe in which they held him.\\n\\nOf course Dr. Schermerhorn had been mistaken in his man: A real\\ncaptain of men would have risen to circumstances wherever he found\\nthem. But who could have foretold? Captain Selover had been a rascal\\nalways, but a successful and courageous rascal. He had run desperate\\nchances, dominated desperate crews. Who could know that a crumble of\\nisland beach and six months ashore would turn him into what he had\\nbecome? Yet I believe such cases are not uncommon in other walks of\\nlife. A man and his work combine to mean something; yet both may be\\nabsolutely useless when separated. It was the weak link----\\n\\nI put in some time praying earnestly that the eyes of the crew might\\nbe blinded, and that the doctor would finish his experiments before\\nthe cauldron could boil up again.\\n\\nMy first act as real commander was to announce holiday. My idea was\\nthat the island would keep the men busy for a while. Then I would\\nassign them more work to do. They proposed at once a tour into the\\ninterior.\\n\\nWe started up the west coast. After three or four miles along a mesa\\nformation where often we had to circle long detours to avoid the\\ngullies, we came upon another short beach, and beyond it a series of\\nledges on which basked several hundred seals. They did not seem\\nalarmed. In fact one old bull, scarred by many battles, made toward\\nus.\\n\\nWe left him, scaled the cliff, and turned up a broad, pleasant valley\\ntoward the interior.\\n\\nThere the later lava flow had been deflected. All that showed of the\\noriginal eruption were occasional red outcropping rocks. Soil and\\ngrass had overlaid the mineral. Scattered trees were planted\\nthroughout the flat. Cacti and semi-tropical bushes mingled with brush\\non the rounded side hills. A number of brilliant birds fluttered at\\nour approach.\\n\\nSuddenly Handy Solomon, who was in advance, stopped and pointed to\\nthe crest of the hill. A file of animals moved along the sky line.\\n\\n\"Mutton!\" said he, \"or the devil\\'s a preacher!\"\\n\\n\"Sheep!\" cried Thrackles. \"Where did they come from?\"\\n\\n\"_Golden Horn_,\" I suggested. \"Remember that wide, empty deck\\nforward? They carried sheep there.\" The men separated, intending fresh\\nmeat. The affair was ridiculous. These sheep had become as wild as\\ndeer. Our surrounding party with its silly bared knives could only\\nlook after them open-mouthed, as they skipped nimbly between its\\nmembers.\\n\\n\"Get a gun of the Old Man, Mr. Eagen,\" suggested Pulz, \"and we\\'ll have\\nsomething besides salt horse and fish.\"\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\nWe continued. The island was like this as far as we went. When we\\nclimbed a ridge, we found ourselves looking down on a spider-web of\\nother valleys and cañons of the same nature, all diverging to broad\\ndowns and a jump into the sea, all converging to the outworks that\\nguarded the volcano with its canopy of vapour.\\n\\nOn our way home we cut across the higher country and the heads of the\\ncañons until we found ourselves looking down on the valley and Dr.\\nSchermerhorn\\'s camp. The steam from the volcanic blowholes swayed\\nbelow us. Through its rifts we saw the tops of the buildings.\\nPresently we made out Percy Darrow, dressed in overalls, his sleeves\\nrolled back, and carrying a retort. He walked, very preoccupied, to\\none of the miniature craters, where he knelt and went through some\\noperation indistinguishable at the distance. I looked around to see\\nmy companions staring at him fascinated, their necks craned out, their\\nbodies drawn back into hiding. In a moment he had finished, and\\ncarried the retort carefully into the laboratory. The men sighed and\\nstood erect, once more themselves. As we turned away Perdosa voiced\\nwhat must have been in the minds of all.\\n\\n\"A man could climb down there,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Why should he want to?\" I demanded sharply.\\n\\n\"_Quien sabe_?\" shrugged he.\\n\\nWe turned in silence toward the beach. Each brooded his thoughts. The\\nsight of that man dressed in overalls, carrying on some mysterious\\nbusiness, brought home to each of us the fact that our expedition had\\nan object, as yet unknown to us. The thought had of late dropped into\\nthe background. For my part I had been so immersed in the adventure\\nand the labour and the insistent need of the hour that I had forgotten\\nwhy I had come. Dr. Schermerhorn\\'s purpose was as inscrutable to me\\nas at first. What had I accomplished?\\n\\nThe men, too, seemed struck with some such idea. There were no yarns\\nabout the camp fire that night. Percy Darrow did not appear, for which\\nI was sincerely sorry. His presence might have created a diversion.\\nFor some unknown reason all my old apprehensions, my sense of\\nimpending disaster, had returned to me strengthened. In the firelight\\nthe Nigger\\'s sullen face looked sinister, Pulz\\'s nervous white\\ncountenance looked vicious. Thrackles\\' heavy, bulldog expression was\\nthreatening, Perdosa\\'s Mexican cast fit for knife work in the back.\\nAnd Handy Solomon, stretched out, leaning on his elbow, with his red\\nheadgear, his snaky hair, his hook nose, his restless eye and his\\nglittering steel claw--the glow wrote across his aura the names of\\nKid, Morgan, Blackbeard. They sat smoking, staring into the fire with\\nmesmerised eyes. The silence got on my nerves I arose impatiently and\\nwalked down the pale beach, where the stars glimmered in splashes\\nalong the wettest sands. The black silhouette of the hills against\\nthe dark blue of the night sky; the white of breakers athwart the\\nindistinct heave of the ocean, a faint light marking the position of\\nthe _Laughing Lass_--that was everything in the world. I made\\nout some object rolled about in the edge of the wash. At the cost of\\nwet feet I rescued it. It was an empty brandy bottle.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"These sheep had become as wild as deer\"]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nCHANGE OF MASTERS\\n\\n\\nThe next day we continued our explorations by land, and so for a week\\nafter that. I thought it best not to relinquish all authority, so I\\norganised regular expeditions, and ordered their direction. The men\\ndid not object. It was all good enough fun to them.\\n\\nThe net results were that we found a nesting place of sea birds--too\\nlate in the season for eggs; a hot spring near enough camp to be\\nuseful; and that was about all. The sheep were the only animals on\\nthe island, although there were several sorts of birds. In general,\\nthe country was as I have described it--either volcanic or overlaid\\nwith fertile earth. In any case it was cañon and hill. We soon grew\\ntired of climbing and turned our attention to the sea.\\n\\nWith the surf boat we skirted the coast. It was impregnable except\\nin three places: our own beach, that near the seal rookery, and on\\nthe south side of the island. We landed at each one of these places.\\nBut returning close to the coast we happened upon a cave mouth more\\nor less guarded by an outlying rock.\\n\\nThe day was calm, so we ventured in. At first I thought it merely a\\ngorge in the rock, but even while peering for the end wall we slipped\\nunder the archway and found ourselves in a vast room.\\n\\nOur eyes were dazzled so we could make out little at first. But\\nthrough the still, clear water the light filtered freely from below,\\nshowing the bottom as through a sea glass. We saw the fish near the\\nentrance, and coral and sea growths of marvellous vividness. They\\nwaved slowly as in a draught of air. The medium in which they floated\\nwas absolutely invisible, for, of course, there were no reflections\\nfrom its surface. We seemed to be suspended in mid-air, and only when\\nthe dipping oars made rings could we realise that anything sustained\\nus.\\n\\nSuddenly the place let loose in pandemonium. The most fiendish cries,\\ngroans, shrieks, broke out, confusing themselves so thoroughly with\\ntheir own echoes that the volume of sound was continuous. Heavy\\nsplashes shook the water. The boat rocked. The invisible surface was\\nbroken into facets.\\n\\nWe shrank, terrified. From all about us glowed hundreds of eyes like\\ncoals of fire--on a level with us, above us, almost over our heads.\\nTwo by two the coals were extinguished.\\n\\nBelow us the bottom was clouded with black figures, darting rapidly\\nlike a school of minnows beneath a boat. They darkened the coral and\\nthe sands and the glistening sea growths just as a cloud temporarily\\ndarkens the landscape--only the occultations and brightenings\\nsucceeded each other much more swiftly.\\n\\nWe stared stupefied, our thinking power blurred by the incessent whirl\\nof motion and noise.\\n\\nSuddenly Thrackles laughed aloud.\\n\\n\"Seals!\" he shouted through his trumpeted hands.\\n\\nOur eyes were expanding to the twilight. We could make out the arch\\nof the room, its shelves, and hollows, and niches. Lying on them we\\ncould discern the seals, hundreds and hundreds of them, all staring\\nat us, all barking and bellowing. As we approached, they scrambled\\nfrom their elevations, and, diving to the bottom, scurried to the entrance\\nof the cave.\\n\\nWe lay on our oars for ten minutes. Then silence fell. There persisted\\na tiny _drip, drip, drip_ from some point in the darkness. It\\nmerely accentuated the hush. Suddenly from far in the interior of the\\nhill there came a long, hollow _boo-o-o-m_! It reverberated,\\nroaring. The surge that had lifted our boat some minutes before thus\\nreached its journey\\'s end.\\n\\nThe chamber was very lofty. As we rowed cautiously in, it lost nothing\\nof its height, but something in width. It was marvellously coloured,\\nlike all the volcanic rocks of this island. In addition some chemical\\ndrip had thrown across its vividness long gauzy streamers of white.\\nWe rowed in as far as the faintest daylight lasted us. The occasional\\nreverberating _boom_ of the surges seemed as distant as ever.\\n\\nThis was beyond the seal rookery on the beach. Below it we entered\\nan open cleft of some size to another squarer cave. It was now high\\ntide; the water extended a scant ten fathoms to end on an interior\\nshale beach. The cave was a perfectly straight passage following the\\nline of the cleft. How far in it reached we could not determine, for\\nit, too, was full of seals, and after we had driven them back a hundred\\nfeet or so their fiery eyes scared us out. We did not care to put them\\nat bay. The next day I rowed out to the _Laughing Lass_ and got\\na rifle. I found the captain asleep in his bunk, and did not disturb\\nhim. Perdosa and I, with infinite pains, tracked and stalked the\\nsheep, of which I killed one. We found the mutton excellent. The\\nhunting was difficult, and the quarry, as time went on, more and more\\nsuspicious, but henceforward we did not lack for fresh meat.\\nFurthermore we soon discovered that fine trolling was to be had\\noutside the reef. We rigged a sail for the extra dory, and spent much\\nof our time at the sport. I do not know the names of the fish. They\\nwere very gamy indeed, and ran from five to an indeterminate number\\nof pounds in weight. Above fifty pounds our light tackle parted, so\\nwe had no means of knowing how large they may have been.\\n\\nThus we spent very pleasantly the greater part of two weeks. At the\\nend of that time I made up my mind that it would be just as well to\\nget back to business. Accordingly I called Perdosa and directed him\\nto sort and clear of rust the salvaged chain cable. He refused flatly.\\nI took a step toward him. He drew his knife and backed away.\\n\\n\"Perdosa,\" said I firmly, \"put up that knife.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he.\\n\\nI pulled the saw-barrelled Colt\\'s 45 and raised it slowly to a level\\nwith his breast.\\n\\n\"Perdosa,\" I repeated, \"drop that knife.\"\\n\\nThe crisis had come, but my resolution was fully prepared for it. I\\nshould not have cared greatly if I had had to shoot the man--as I\\ncertainly should have done had he disobeyed. There would then have\\nbeen one less to deal with in the final accounting, which strangely\\nenough I now for a moment never doubted would come. I had not before\\naimed at a man\\'s life, so you can see to what tensity the baffling\\nmystery had strung me.\\n\\nPerdosa hesitated a fraction of an instant. I really think he might\\nhave chanced it, but Handy Solomon, who had been watching me closely,\\ngrowled at him.\\n\\n\"Drop it, you fool!\" he said.\\n\\nPerdosa let fall the knife.\\n\\n\"Now, get at that cable,\" I commanded, still at white heat. I stood\\nover him until he was well at work, then turned back to set tasks for\\nthe other men. Handy Solomon met me halfway.\\n\\n\"Begging your pardon, Mr. Eagen,\" said he, \"I want a word with you.\"\\n\\n\"I have nothing to say to you,\" I snapped, still excited.\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t reasonable not to hear a man\\'s say,\" he advised in his most\\nconciliatory manner, \"I\\'m talking for all of us.\"\\n\\nHe paused a moment, took my silence for consent, and went ahead.\\n\\n\\n\"Begging your pardon, Mr. Eagen,\" said he, \"we ain\\'t going to do any\\nmore useless work. There ain\\'t no laziness about us, but we ain\\'t\\ngoing to be busy at nothing. All the camp work and the haulin\\' and\\ncuttin\\' and cleanin\\' and the rest of it, we\\'ll do gladly. But we ain\\'t\\ngoin\\' to pound any more cable, and you can kiss the Book on that.\"\\n\\n\"You mean to mutiny?\" I asked.\\n\\nHe made a deprecatory gesture.\\n\\n\"Put us aboard ship, sir, and let us hear the Old Man give his orders,\\nand you\\'ll find no mutiny in us. But here ashore it\\'s different. Did\\nthe Old Man give orders to pound the cable?\"\\n\\n\"I represent the captain,\" I stammered.\\n\\nHe caught the evasion. \"I thought so. Well, if you got any kick on\\nus, please, sir, go get the Old Man. If he says to our face, pound\\ncable, why pound cable it is. Ain\\'t that right, boys?\"\\n\\nThey murmured something. Perdosa deliberately dropped his hammer and\\njoined the group. My hand strayed again toward the sawed-off Colt\\'s\\n45.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t do that,\" said Handy Solomon, almost kindly. \"You couldn\\'t\\nkill us all. And w\\'at good would it do? I asks you that. I can cut\\ndown a chicken with my knife at twenty feet. You must surely see, sir,\\nthat I could have killed you too easy while you were covering Pancho\\nthere. This ain\\'t got to be a war, Mr. Eagen, just because we don\\'t\\nwant to work without any sense to it.\"\\n\\nThere was more of the same sort. I had plenty of time to see my\\ndilemma. Either I would have to abandon my attempt to keep the men\\nbusy, or I would have to invoke the authority of Captain Selover. To\\ndo the latter would be to destroy it. The master had become a stuffed\\nfigure, a bogie with which to frighten, an empty bladder that a prick\\nwould collapse. With what grace I could muster, I had to give in.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to have it your own way, I suppose,\" I snapped.\\n\\nThrackles grinned, and Pulz started to say something, but Handy\\nSolomon, with a peremptory gesture, and a black scowl, stopped him\\nshort.\\n\\n\"Now that\\'s what I calls right proper and handsome!\" he cried\\nadmiringly. \"We reely had no right to expect that, boys, as seamen,\\nfrom our first officer! You can kiss the Book on it, that very few\\ncrews have such kind masters. Mr. Eagen has the right, and we signed\\nto it all straight, to work us as he pleases; and w\\'at does he do?\\nWhy, he up and gives us a week shore leave, and then he gives us light\\nwatches, and all the time our pay goes on just the same. Now that\\'s\\nw\\'at I calls right proper and handsome conduct, or the devil\\'s a\\npreacher, and I ventures with all respect to propose three cheers for\\nMr. Eagen.\"\\n\\nThey gave them, grinning broadly. The villain stood looking at me,\\na sardonic gleam in the back of his eye. Then he gave a little hitch\\nto his red head covering, and sauntered away humming between his teeth.\\nI stood watching him, choked with rage and indecision. The humming\\nbroke into words.\\n\\n  \"\\'Oh, quarter, oh, quarter!\\' the jolly pirates cried.\\n     _Blow high, blow low! What care we_?\\n  But the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea,\\n     _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_.\"\\n\\n\"Here, you swab,\" he cried to Thrackles, \"and you, Pancho! get some\\nwood, lively! And Pulz, bring us a pail of water. Doctor, let\\'s have\\nduff to celebrate on.\"\\n\\nThe men fell to work with alacrity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\nTHE CORROSIVE\\n\\n\\nThat evening I smoked in a splendid isolation while the men whispered\\napart. I had nothing to do but smoke, and to chew my cud, which was\\nbitter. There could be no doubt, however I may have saved my face,\\nthat command had been taken from me by that rascal, Handy Solomon.\\nI was in two minds as to whether or not I should attempt to warn Darrow\\nor the doctor. Yet what could I say? and against whom should I warn\\nthem? The men had grumbled, as men always do grumble in idleness, and\\nhad perhaps talked a little wildly; but that was nothing.\\n\\nThe only indisputable fact I could adduce was that I had allowed my\\nauthority to slip through my fingers. And adequately to excuse that,\\nI should have to confess that I was a writer and no handler of men.\\n\\nI abandoned the unpleasant train of thought with a snort of disgust,\\nbut it had led me to another. In the joy and uncertainty of living\\nI had practically lost sight of the reason for my coming. With me it\\nhad always been more the adventure than the story; my writing was a\\nby-product, a utilisation of what life offered me. I had set sail\\npossessed by the sole idea of ferreting out Dr. Schermerhorn\\'s\\ninvestigations, but the gradual development of affairs had ended by\\nabsorbing my every faculty. Now, cast into an eddy by my change of\\nfortunes, the original idea regained its force. I was out of the\\nactive government of affairs, with leisure on my hands, and my\\nthoughts naturally turned with curiosity again to the laboratory in\\nthe valley.\\n\\nDarrow\\'s \"devil fires\" were again painting the sky. I had noticed them\\nfrom time to time, always with increasing wonder. The men accepted\\nthem easily as only one of the unexplained phenomena of a sailor\\'s\\nexperience, but I had not as yet hit on a hypothesis that suited me.\\nThey were not allied to the aurora; they differed radically from the\\nordinary volcanic emanations; and scarcely resembled any electrical\\ndisplays I had ever seen. The night was cool; the stars bright: I\\nresolved to investigate.\\n\\nWithout further delay I arose to my feet and set off into the\\ndarkness. Immediately one of the group detached himself from the fire\\nand joined me.\\n\\n\"Going for a little walk, sir?\" asked Handy Solomon sweetly. \"That\\'s\\nquite right and proper. Nothin\\' like a little walk to get you fit and\\nright for your bunk.\"\\n\\nHe held close to my elbow. We got just as far as the stockade in the\\nbed of the arroyo. The lights we could make out now across the zenith;\\nbut owing to the precipitance of the cliffs, and the rise of the\\narroyo bed, it was impossible to see more. Handy Solomon felt the\\ndefences carefully.\\n\\n\"A man would think, sir, it was a cannibal island,\" he observed. \"All\\nso tight and tidy-like here. It would take a ship\\'s guns to batter\\nher down. A man might dig under these here two gate logs, if no one\\nwas against him. Like to try it, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I answered gruffly.\\n\\nFrom that time on I was virtually a prisoner; yet so carefully was\\nmy surveillance accomplished that I could place my finger on nothing\\ndefinite. Someone always accompanied me on my walks; and in the\\nevening I was herded as closely as any cattle.\\n\\nHandy Solomon took the direction of affairs off my hands. You may be\\nsure he set no very heavy tasks. The men cut a little wood, carried\\nup a few pails of water--that was all.\\n\\nLacking incentive to stir about, they came to spend most of their time\\nlying on their backs watching the sky. This in turn bred a languor\\nwhich is the sickest, most soul- and temper-destroying affair invented\\nby the devil. They could not muster up energy enough to walk down the\\nbeach and back, and yet they were wearied to death of the inaction.\\nAfter a little they became irritable toward one another. Each\\nsuspected the other of doing less than he should. You who know men\\nwill realise what this meant.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of our camp became surly. I recognised the precursor\\nof its becoming dangerous. One day on a walk in the hills I came on\\nThrackles and Pulz lying on their stomachs gazing down fixedly at Dr.\\nSchermerhorn\\'s camp. This was nothing extraordinary, but they started\\nguiltily to their feet when they saw me, and made off, growling under\\ntheir breaths.\\n\\nAll this that I have told you so briefly, took time. It was the eating\\nthrough of men\\'s spirits by that worst of corrosives, idleness. I\\nconceive it unnecessary to weary you with the details----\\n\\nThe situation was as yet uneasy but not alarming. One evening I\\noverheard the beginning of an absurd plot to gain entrance to the\\nValley--that was as far as detail went. I became convinced at last\\nthat I should in some way warn Percy Darrow.\\n\\nThat seems a simple enough proposition, does it not? But if you will\\nstop to think one moment of the difficulties of my position, you will\\nsee that it was not as easy as at first it appears. Darrow still\\nvisited us in the evening. The men never allowed me even the chance\\nof private communication while he was with us. One or two took pains\\nto stretch out between us. Twice I arose when the assistant did, resolved\\nto accompany him part way back. Both times men resolutely escorted\\nus, and as resolutely separated us from the opportunity of a single\\nword apart. The crew never threatened me by word or look. But we understood\\neach other.\\n\\nI was not permitted to row out to the _Laughing Lass_ without\\nescort. Therefore I never attempted to visit her again. The men were\\nnot anxious to do so, their awe of the captain made them only too glad\\nto escape his notice. That empty shell of a past reputation was my\\nonly hope. It shielded the arms and ammunition.\\n\\nAs I look back on it now, the period seems to me to be one of merely\\npotential trouble. The men had not taken the pains to crystallise\\ntheir ideas. I really think their compelling emotion was that of\\ncuriosity. They wanted to _see_. It needed a definite impulse\\nto change that desire to one of greed.\\n\\nThe impulse came from Percy Darrow and his idle talk of voodoos. As\\nusual he was directing his remarks to the sullen Nigger.\\n\\n\"Voodoos?\" he said. \"Of course there are. Don\\'t fool yourself for a\\nminute on that. There are good ones and bad ones. You can tame them\\nif you know how, and they will do anything you want them to.\" Pulz\\nchuckled in his throat. \"You don\\'t believe it?\" drawled the assistant\\nturning to him. \"Well, it\\'s so. You know that heavy box we are so\\ncareful of? Well, that\\'s got a tame voodoo in it.\"\\n\\nThe others laughed.\\n\\n\"What he like?\" asked the Nigger gravely.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a fine voodoo, with wavery arms and green eyes, and red glows.\"\\nWatching narrowly its effect he swung off into one of the genuine old\\ncrooning voodoo songs, once so common down South, now so rarely heard.\\nNo one knows what the words mean--they are generally held to be\\ncharm-words only--a magic gibberish. But the Nigger sprang across the\\nfire like lightning, his face altered by terror, to seize Darrow by\\nthe shoulders.\\n\\n\"Doan you! Doan you!\" he gasped, shaking the assistant violently back\\nand forth. \"Dat he King Voodoo song! Dat call him all de voodoo--all!\"\\n\\nHe stared wildly about in the darkness as though expecting to see the\\nnight thronged. There was a moment of confusion. Eager for any chance\\nI hissed under my breath; \"Danger! Look out!\"\\n\\nI could not tell whether or not Darrow heard me. He left soon after.\\nThe mention of the chest had focussed the men\\'s interest.\\n\\n\"Well,\" Pulz began, \"we\\'ve been here on this spot o\\' hell for a long\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"A year and five months,\" reckoned Thrackles.\\n\\n\"A man can do a lot in that time.\"\\n\\n\"If he\\'s busy.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ve been busy.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Wonder what they\\'ve done?\"\\n\\nThere was no answer to this, and the sea lawyer took a new tack.\\n\\n\"I suppose we\\'re all getting double wages.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so.\"\\n\\n\"And that\\'s say four hunder\\' for us and Mr. Eagen here. I suppose the\\nOld Man don\\'t let the schooner go for nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Two hundred and fifty a month,\" said I, and then would have had the\\nwords back.\\n\\nThey cried out in prolonged astonishment.\\n\\n\"Seventeen months,\" pursued the logician after a few moments. He\\nscratched with a stub of lead. \"That makes over eleven thousand\\ndollars since we\\'ve been out. How much do you suppose his outfit\\nstands him?\" he appealed to me.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I can\\'t tell you,\" I replied shortly.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a pile of money, anyway.\"\\n\\nNobody said anything for some time.\\n\\n\"Wonder what they\\'ve done?\" Pulz asked again.\\n\\n\"Something that pays big.\" Thrackles supplied the desired answer.\\n\\n\"Dat chis\\'----\" suggested Perdosa.\\n\\n\"Voodoo----\" muttered the Nigger.\\n\\n\"That\\'s to scare us out,\" said Handy Solomon, with vast contempt.\\n\"That\\'s what makes me sure it _is_ the chest.\"\\n\\nPulz muttered some of the jargon of alchemy.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" approved Handy Solomon. \"If we could get----\"\\n\\n\"We wouldn\\'t know how to use it,\" interrupted Pulz.\\n\\n\"The book----\" said Thrackles.\\n\\n\"Well, the book----\" asserted Pulz pugnaciously.\\n\\n\"How do you know what it will be? It may be the Philosopher\\'s Stone\\nand it may be one of these other damn things. And then where\\'d we be?\"\\n\\nIt was astounding to hear this nonsense bandied about so seriously.\\nAnd yet they more than half believed, for they were deep-sea men of\\nthe old school, and this was in print. Thrackles voiced approximately\\nthe general attitude.\\n\\n\"Philosopher\\'s stone or not, something\\'s up. The old boy took too good\\ncare of that box, and he\\'s spending too much money, and he\\'s got hold\\nof too much hell afloat to be doing it for his health.\"\\n\\n\"You know w\\'at I t\\'ink?\" smiled Perdosa. \"He mak\\' di\\'mon\\'s. He\\n_say_ dat.\"\\n\\nThe Nigger had entered one of his black, brooding moods from which\\nthese men expected oracles.\\n\\n\"Get him ches\\',\" he muttered. \"I see him full--full of di\\'mon\\'s!\"\\n\\nThey listened to him with vast respect, and were visibly impressed.\\nSo deep was the sense of awe that Handy Solomon unbent enough to whisper\\nto me:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t take any stock in the Nigger\\'s talk _ordinarily_. He\\'s\\na hell of a fool nigger. But when his eye looks like that, then you\\nwant to listen close. He sees things then. Lots of times he\\'s seen\\nthings. Even last year--the _Oyama_--he told about her three days\\nahead. That\\'s why we were so ready for her,\" he chuckled.\\n\\nNothing more developed for a long time except a savage fight between\\nPulz and Perdosa. I hunted sheep, fished, wandered about--always with\\nan escort tired to death before he started. The thought came to me\\nto kill this man and so to escape and make cause with the scientists.\\nMy common sense forbade me. I begin to think that common sense is a\\nvery foolish faculty indeed.\\n\\nIt taught me the obvious--that all this idle, vapouring talk was\\ncommon enough among men of this class, so common that it would hardly\\njustify a murder, would hardly explain an unwarranted intrusion on\\nthose who employed me. How would it look for me to go to them with\\nthese words in my mouth:\\n\\n\"The captain has taken to drinking to dull the monotony. The crew\\nthink you are an alchemist and are making diamonds. Their interest\\nin this fact seemed to me excessive, so I killed one of them, and here\\nI am.\"\\n\\n\"And who are you?\" they could ask.\\n\\n\"I am a reporter,\" would be my only truthful reply.\\n\\nYou can see the false difficulties of my position. I do not defend\\nmy attitude. Undoubtedly a born leader of men, like Captain Selover\\nat his best, would have known how to act with the proper decision both\\nnow and in the inception of the first mutiny. At heart I never doubted\\nthe reality of the crisis.\\n\\nEven Percy Darrow saw the surliness of the men\\'s attitudes, and with\\nhis usual good sense divined the cause.\\n\\n\"You chaps are getting lazy,\" said he, \"why don\\'t you do something?\\nWhere\\'s the captain?\"\\n\\nThey growled something about there being nothing to do, and explained\\nthat the captain preferred to live aboard.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t blame him,\" said Darrow, \"but he might give us a little of his\\nsqueaky company occasionally. Boys, I\\'ll tell you something about\\nseals. The old bull seals have long, stiff whiskers--a foot long. Do\\nyou know there\\'s a market for those whiskers? Well, there is. The\\nChinese mount them in gold and use them for cleaners for their long\\npipes. Each whisker is worth from six bits to a dollar and a quarter.\\nWhy don\\'t you kill a few bull seal for the \\'trimmings\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Nothin\\' to do with a voodoo?\" grunted Handy Solomon.\\n\\nDarrow laughed amusedly. \"No, this is the truth,\" he assured. \"I\\'ll\\ntell you what: I\\'ll give you boys six bits apiece for the whisker\\nhairs, and four bits for the galls. I expect to sell them at a\\nprofit.\"\\n\\nNext morning they shook off their lethargy and went seal-hunting.\\nI was practically commanded to attend. This attitude had been growing\\nof late: now it began to take a definite form.\\n\\n\"Mr. Eagan, don\\'t you want to go hunting?\" or \"Mr. Eagen, I guess I\\'ll\\njust go along with you to stretch my legs,\" had given way to, \"We\\'re\\ngoing fishing: you\\'d better come along.\"\\n\\nI had known for a long time that I had lost any real control of them;\\nand that perhaps humiliated me a little. However, my inexperience at\\nhandling such men, and the anomalous character of my position to some\\nextent consoled me. In the filaments brushed across the face of my\\nunderstanding I could discover none so strong as to support an overt\\nact on my part. I cannot doubt, that had the affair come to a focus,\\nI should have warned the scientists even at the risk of my life. In\\nfact, as I shall have occasion to show you, I did my best. But at the\\nmoment, in all policy I could see my way to little besides\\nacquiescence.\\n\\nWe killed seals by sequestrating the bulls, surrounding them, and\\nclubbing them at a certain point of the forehead. It was surprising\\nto see how hard they fought, and how quickly they succumbed to a blow\\nproperly directed. Then we stripped the mask with its bristle of long\\nwhiskers, took the gall, and dragged the carcass into the surf where\\nit was devoured by fish. At first the men, pleased by the novelty,\\nstripped the skins. The blubber, often two or three inches in\\nthickness, had then to be cut away from the pelt, cube by cube. It\\nwas a long, an oily, and odoriferous job. We stunk mightily of seal\\noil; our garments were shiny with it, the very pores of our skins seemed\\nto ooze it. And even after the pelt was fairly well cleared, it had\\nstill to be tanned. Percy Darrow suggested the method, but the process\\nwas long, and generally unsatisfactory. With the acquisition of the\\nfifth greasy, heavy, and ill-smelling piece of fur the men\\'s interest\\nin peltries waned. They confined themselves in all strictness to the\\n\"trimmings.\"\\n\\nPercy Darrow showed us how to clean the whiskers. The process was\\nevil. The masks were, quite simply, to be advanced so far in the way\\nof putrefaction that the bristles would part readily from their\\nsockets. The first batch the men hung out on a line. A few moments\\nlater we heard a mighty squawking, and rushed out to find the island\\nravens making off with the entire catch. Protection of netting had\\nto be rigged. We caught seals for a month or so. There was novelty\\nin it, and it satisfied the lust for killing. As time went on, the\\nbulls grew warier. Then we made expeditions to outlying rocks.\\n\\nLater Handy Solomon approached me on another diplomatic errand.\\n\\n\"The seals is getting shy, sir,\" said he.\\n\\n\"They are,\" said I.\\n\\n\"The only way to do is to shoot them,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Quite like,\" I agreed.\\n\\nA pause ensued.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got no cartridges,\" he insinuated.\\n\\n\"And you\\'ve taken charge of my rifle,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n\"Oh, not a bit, sir,\" he cried. \"Thrackles, he just took it to clean\\nit--you can have it whenever you want it, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I have no cartridges--as you have observed,\" said I.\\n\\n\"There\\'s plenty aboard,\" he suggested.\\n\\n\"And they\\'re in very good hands there,\" said I.\\n\\nHe ruminated a moment, polishing the steel of his hook against the\\nother arm of his shirt. Suddenly he looked up at me with a humorous\\ntwinkle.\\n\\n\"You\\'re afraid of us!\" he accused.\\n\\nI was silent, not knowing just how to meet so direct an attack.\\n\\n\"No need to be,\" he continued.\\n\\nI said nothing.\\n\\nHe looked at me shrewdly; then stood off on another tack.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I didn\\'t mean just that. I didn\\'t mean you was really\\nscared of us. But we\\'re gettin\\' to know each other, livin\\' here on\\nthis old island, brothers-like. There ain\\'t no officers and men\\nashore--is there, now, sir? When we gets back to the old _Laughing\\nLass_, then we drops back into our dooty again all right and\\nproper. You can kiss the Book on that. Old Scrubs, he knows that. He\\ndon\\'t want no shore in his. _He_ knows enough to stay aboard,\\nwhere we\\'d all rather be.\"\\n\\nHe stopped abruptly, spat, and looked at me. I wondered whither this\\ndevious diplomacy led us.\\n\\n\"Still, in one way, an officer\\'s an officer, and a seaman\\'s a seaman,\\nthinks you, and discipline must be held up among mates ashore or\\nafloat, thinks you. Quite proper, sir. And I can see you think that\\nthe arms is for the afterguard except in case of trouble. Quite\\nproper. You can do the shooting, and you can keep the cartridges\\nalways by you. Just for discipline, sir.\"\\n\\nThe man\\'s boldness in so fully arming me was astonishing, and his\\ncarelessness in allowing me aboard with Captain Selover astonished\\nme still more. Nevertheless I promised to go for the desired cartridges,\\nfully resolved to make an appeal.\\n\\nA further consideration of the elements of the game convinced me,\\nhowever, of the fellow\\'s shrewdness. It was no more dangerous to allow\\nme a rifle--under direct surveillance--for the purposes of hunting,\\nthan to leave me my sawed--off revolver, which I still retained. The\\narguments he had used against my shooting Perdosa were quite as cogent\\nnow. As to the second point, I, finding the sun unexpectedly strong,\\nreturned from the cove for my hat, and so overheard the following\\nbetween Thrackles and his leader:\\n\\n\"What\\'s to keep him from staying aboard?\" cried Thrackles, protesting.\\n\\n\"Well, he might,\" acknowledged Handy Solomon, \"and then are we the\\nworse off? You ain\\'t going to make a boat attack against Old Scrubs,\\nare you?\"\\n\\nThrackles hesitated.\\n\\n\"You can kiss the Book on it, you ain\\'t,\" went on Handy Solomon\\neasily, \"nor me, nor Pulz, nor the Greaser, nor the Nigger, nor none\\nof us all together. We\\'ve had our dose of that. Well, if he goes\\naboard and _stays_, where are we the worse off? I asks you that.\\nBut he won\\'t. This is w\\'ats goin\\' to happen. Says he to Old Scrubs,\\n\\'Sir, the men needs you to bash in their heads.\\' \\'Bash \\'em in\\nyourself,\\' says he, \\'that\\'s w\\'at you\\'re for.\\' And if he should come\\nashore, w\\'at could he do? I asks you that. We ain\\'t disobeyed no\\norders dooly delivered. We\\'re ready to pull halliards at the word.\\nNo, let him go aboard, and if he peaches to the Old Man, why all the\\nbetter, for it just gets the Old Man down on him.\"\\n\\n\"How about Old Scrubs----\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you believe none in luck?\" asked Handy Solomon. \"Aye.\"\\n\\n\"Well, so do I, with w\\'at that law-crimp used to call joodicious\\nassistance.\"\\n\\nI rowed out to the _Laughing Lass_ very thoughtful, and a little\\nshaken by the plausible argument. Captain Selover was lying dead drunk\\nacross the cabin table. I did my best to waken him, but failed, took\\na score of cartridges--no more--and departed sadly. Nothing could be\\ngained by staying aboard; every chance might be lost. Besides, an\\nopening to escape in the direction of the laboratory might offer--I,\\nas well as they, believed in luck judiciously assisted.\\n\\nIn the ensuing days I learned much of the habits of seals. We sneaked\\nalong the cliff tops until over the rookeries; then lay flat on our\\nstomachs and peered cautiously down on our quarry. The seals had\\nbecome very wary. A slight jar, the fall of a pebble, sometimes even\\nsounds unnoticed by ourselves, were enough to send them into the\\nwater. There they lined up just outside the surf, their sleek heads\\nglossy with the wet, their calm, soft eyes fixed unblinkingly on us.\\n\\nIt was useless to shoot them in the water: they sank at once.\\n\\nWhen, however, we succeeded in gaining an advantageous position, it\\nwas necessary to shoot with extreme accuracy. A bullet directly\\nthrough the back of the head would kill cleanly. A hit anywhere else\\nwas practically useless, for even in death the animals seemed to\\nretain enough blind instinctive vitality to flop them into the water.\\nThere they were lost.\\n\\nEach rookery consisted of one tremendous bull who officiated\\napparently as the standing army; a number of smaller bulls, his direct\\ndescendants; the cows, and the pups. The big bull held his position\\nby force of arms. Occasionally other, unattached, bulls would come\\nswimming by. On arriving opposite the rookery the stranger would utter\\na peculiar challenge. It was never refused by the resident champion,\\nwho promptly slid into the sea, and engaged battle. If he conquered,\\nthe stranger went on his way. If, however, the stranger won, the big\\nbull immediately struck out to sea, abandoning his rookery, while the\\nnew-comer swam in and attempted to make his title good with all the\\nyounger bulls. I have seen some fierce combats out there in the blue\\nwater. They gashed each other deep----\\n\\nYou can see by this how our hunting was never at an end. On Tuesday\\nwe would kill the boss bull of a certain establishment. By Thursday,\\nat latest, another would be installed.\\n\\nI learned curious facts about seals in those days. The hunting did\\nnot appeal to me particularly, because it seemed to me useless to kill\\nso large an animal for so small a spoil. Still, it was a means to my\\nall-absorbing end, and I confess that the stalking, the lying belly\\ndown on the sun-warmed grass over the surge and under the clear sky,\\nwas extremely pleasant. While awaiting the return of the big bull often\\nwe had opportunity to watch the others at their daily affairs, and\\neven the unresponsive Thrackles was struck with their almost human\\nintelligence. Did you know that seals kiss each other, and weep tears\\nwhen grieved?\\n\\nThe men often discussed among themselves the narrow, dry cave. There\\nthe animals were practically penned in. They agreed that a great\\nkilling could be made there, but the impossibility of distinguishing\\nbetween the bulls and the cows deterred them. The cave was quite dark.\\n\\nImmerced in our own affairs thus, the days, weeks, and months went\\nby. Events had slipped beyond my control. I had embarked on a journalistic\\nenterprise, and now that purpose was entirely out of my reach.\\n\\nUp the valley Dr. Schermerhorn and his assistant were engaged in some\\nexperiment of whose very nature I was still ignorant. Also I was\\nlikely to remain so. The precautions taken against interference by\\nthe men were equally effective against me. As if that were not enough,\\nany move of investigation on my part would be radically misinterpreted,\\nand to my own danger, by the men. I might as well have been in London.\\n\\nHowever, as to my first purpose in this adventure I had evolved\\nanother plan, and therefore was content. I made up my mind that on\\nthe voyage home, if nothing prevented, I would tell my story to Percy\\nDarrow, and throw myself on his mercy. The results of the experiment\\nwould probably by then be ready for the public, and there was no\\nreason, as far as I could see, why I should not get the \"scoop\" at\\nfirst hand.\\n\\nCertainly my sincerity would be without question; and I hoped that\\ntwo years or more of service such as I had rendered would tickle Dr.\\nSchermerhorn\\'s sense of his own importance. So adequate did this plan\\nseem, that I gave up thought on the subject.\\n\\nMy whole life now lay on the shores. I was not again permitted to\\nboard the _Laughing Lass_. Captain Selover I saw twice at a\\ndistance. Both times he seemed to be rather uncertain. The men did\\nnot remark it. The days went by. I relapsed into that state so well\\nknown to you all, when one seems caught in the meshes of a dream existence\\nwhich has had no beginning and which is destined never to have an end.\\n\\nWe were to hunt seals, and fish, and pry bivalves from the rocks at\\nlow tide, and build fires, and talk, and alternate between suspicion\\nand security, between the danger of sedition and the insanity of men\\nwithout defined purpose, world without end forever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\n\"OLD SCRUBS\" COMES ASHORE\\n\\n\\nThe inevitable happened. One noon Pulz looked up from his labour of\\npulling the whiskers from the evil-smelling masks.\\n\\n\\n\"How many of these damn things we got?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"About three hunder\\' and fifty,\" Thrackles replied.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve got enough for me. I\\'m sick of this job. It stinks.\"\\n\\nThey looked at each other. I could see the disgust rising in their\\neyes, the reek of rotten blubber expanding their nostrils. With one\\naccord they cast aside the masks.\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t such a hell of a fortune,\" growled Pulz, his evil little\\nwhite face thrust forward. \"There\\'s other things worth all the seal\\ntrimmin\\'s of the islands.\"\\n\\n\"Diamon\\'s,\" gloomed the Nigger.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve hit it, Doctor,\" cut in Solomon.\\n\\nThere we were again, back to the old difficulty, only worse. Idleness\\ndescended on us again. We grew touchy on little things, as a misplaced\\nplate, a shortage of firewood, too deep a draught at the nearly empty\\nbucket. The noise of bickering became as constant as the noise of the\\nsurf. If we valued peace, we kept our mouths shut. The way a man spat,\\nor ate, or slept, or even breathed became a cause of irritation to\\nevery other member of the company. We stood the outrage as long as\\nwe could; then we objected in a wild and ridiculous explosion which\\ncommunicated its heat to the object of our wrath. Then there was a\\nfight. It needed only liquor to complete the deplorable state of\\naffairs.\\n\\nGradually the smaller things came to worry us more and more. A certain\\nharmless singer of the cricket or perhaps of the tree-toad variety\\nused to chirp his innocent note a short distance from our cabin. For\\nall I know he had done so from the moment of our installation, but\\nI had never noticed him before. Now I caught myself listening for his\\nirregular recurrence with every nerve on the quiver. If he delayed\\nby ever so little, it was an agony; yet when he did pipe up, his feeble\\nstrain struck to my heart cold and paralysing like a dagger. And with\\nevery advancing minute of the night I became broader awake, more\\ntense, fairly sweating with nervousness. One night--good God, was it\\nonly last week? ... it seems ages ago, another existence ... a state\\ncut off from this by the wonder of a transmigration, at least ... Last\\nweek!\\n\\nI did not sleep at all. The moon had risen, had mounted the heavens,\\nand now was sailing overhead. By the fretwork of its radiance through\\nthe chinks of our rudely-built cabin I had marked off the hours. A\\nthunderstorm rumbled and flashed, hull down over the horizon. It was\\nmany miles distant, and yet I do not doubt that its electrical\\ninfluence had dried the moisture of our equanimity, leaving us\\nrattling husks for the winds of destiny to play upon. Certainly I can\\nremember no other time, in a rather wide experience, when I have felt\\nmyself more on edge, more choked with the restless, purposeless\\nnervous energy that leaves a man\\'s tongue parched and his eyes\\nstaring. And still that infernal cricket, or whatever it was, chirped.\\n\\nI had thought myself alone in my vigil, but when finally I could stand\\nit no longer, and kicked aside my covering with an oath of protest,\\nI was surprised to hear it echoed from all about me.\\n\\n\"Damn that cricket!\" I cried.\\n\\nAnd the dead shadows stirred from the bunks, and the hollow-eyed\\nvictims of insomnia crept out to curse their tormentor. We organised\\nan expedition to hunt him down. It was ridiculous enough, six strong\\nmen prowling for the life of one poor little insect. We did not find\\nhim, however, though we succeeded in silencing him. But no sooner were\\nwe back in our bunks than he began it again, and such was the turmoil\\nof our nerves that day found us sitting wan about a fire, hugging our\\nknees.\\n\\nWe were so genuinely emptied, not so much by the cricket as by the\\ntwo years of fermentation, that not one of us stirred toward breakfast,\\nin fact not one of us moved from the listless attitude in which day\\nfound him, until after nine o\\'clock. Then we pulled ourselves together\\nand cooked coffee and salt horse. As a significant fact, the Nigger\\nleft the dishes unwashed, and no one cared.\\n\\nHandy Solomon finally shook himself and arose.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sick of this,\" said he, \"I\\'m goin\\' seal-hunting.\"\\n\\nThey arose without a word. They were sick of it, too, sick to death.\\nWe were a silent, gloomy crew indeed as we thrust the surf boat\\nafloat, clambered in, and shipped the oars. No one spoke a word; no\\none had a comment to make, even when we saw the rookery slide into\\nthe water while we were still fifty yards from the beach. We pulled\\nback slowly along the coast. Beyond the rock we made out the entrance\\nto the dry cave.\\n\\n\"There\\'s seal in there,\" cried Handy Solomon, \"lots of \\'em!\"\\n\\nHe thrust the rudder over, and we headed for the cave. No one\\nexpressed an opinion.\\n\\nAs it was again high tide, we rowed in to the steep shore inside the\\ncave\\'s mouth and beached the boat. The place was full of seals; we\\ncould hear them bellowing.\\n\\n\"Two of you stand here,\" shouted Handy Solomon, \"and take them as they\\ngo out. We\\'ll go in and scare \\'em down to you.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ll run over us,\" screamed Pulz.\\n\\n\"No, they won\\'t. You can dodge up the sides when they go by.\"\\n\\nThis was indeed well possible, so we gripped our clubs and ventured\\ninto the darkness.\\n\\nWe advanced four abreast, for the cave was wide enough for that. As\\nwe penetrated, the bellowing and barking became more deafening.\\nIt was impossible to see anything, although we _felt_ an\\nindistinguishable tumbling mass receding before our footsteps.\\nThrackles swore violently as he stumbled over a laggard. With uncanny\\nabruptness the black wall of darkness in front of us was alive with\\nfiery eyeballs. The seals had reached the end of the cave and had\\nturned toward us. We, too, stopped, a little uncertain as to how to\\nproceed.\\n\\nThe first plan had been to get behind the band and to drive it slowly\\ntoward the entrance to the cave. This was now seen to be impossible.\\nThe cavern was too narrow; its sides at this point too steep, and the\\nanimals too thickly congested. Our eyes, becoming accustomed to the\\ntwilight, now began to make out dimly the individual bodies of the\\nseals and the general configuration of the rocks. One big boulder lay\\ndirectly in our path, like an island in the shale of the cave\\'s floor.\\nPerdosa stepped to the top of it for a better look. The men attempted\\nto communicate their ideas of what was to be done, but could not make\\nthemselves heard above the uproar. I could see their faces contorting\\nwith the fury of being baffled. A big bull made a dash to get by; all\\nthe herd flippered after him. If he had won past they would have\\nfollowed as obstinately as sheep, and nothing could have stopped them,\\nbut the big bull went down beneath the clubs. Thrackles hit the animal\\ntwo vindictive blows after it had succumbed.\\n\\nThis settled the revolt, and we stood as before. Pulz and Handy\\nSolomon tried to converse by signs, but evidently failed, for their\\nfaces showed angry in the twilight. Perdosa, on his rock, rolled and\\nlit a cigarette. Thrackles paced to and fro, and the Nigger leaned\\non his club, farther down the cave. They had been left at the entrance,\\nbut now in lack of results had joined their companions.\\n\\nNow Thrackles approached and screamed himself black trying to impart\\nsome plan. He failed; but stooped and picked up a stone and threw it\\ninto the mass of seals. The others understood. A shower of stones\\nfollowed. The animals milled like cattle, bellowed the louder, but\\nwould not face their tormentors. Finally an old cow flopped by in a\\npanic. I thought they would have let her go, but she died a little\\nbeyond the bull. No more followed, although the men threw stones as\\nfast and hard as they were able. Their faces were livid with anger,\\nlike that of an evil-tempered man with an obstinate horse.\\n\\nSuddenly Handy Solomon put his head down, and with a roar distinctly\\naudible even above the din that filled the cave, charged directly into\\nthe herd. I saw the beasts cringe before him; I saw his club rising\\nand falling indiscriminately; and then the whole back of the cave\\nseemed to rise and come at us.\\n\\nThis was no chance of sport now, but a struggle for very life. We\\nrealised that once down there would be no hope, for while the seals\\nwere more anxious to escape than to fight, we knew that their jaws\\nwere powerful. There was no time to pick and choose. We hit out with\\nall the strength and quickness we possessed. It was like a bad dream,\\nlike struggling with an elusive hydra-headed monster, knee high,\\ninvulnerable. We hit, but without apparent effect. New heads rose,\\nthe press behind increased. We gave ground. We staggered, struggling\\ndesperately to keep our feet.\\n\\nHow long this lasted I cannot tell. It seemed hours. I know my arms\\nbecame leaden from swinging my club; my eyes were full of sweat; my\\nbreath gasped. A sharp pain in my knee nearly doubled me to the ground\\nand yet I remember clamping to the thought that I must keep my feet,\\nkeep my feet at any cost. Then all at once I recalled the fact that\\nI was armed. I jerked out the short-barrelled Colt\\'s 45 and turned\\nit loose in their faces.\\n\\nWhether the flash and detonation frightened them; whether Perdosa,\\nstill clinging to his rock, managed to turn their attention by his\\nflanking efforts, or whether, quite simply, the wall of dead finally\\nturned them back, I do not know, but with one accord they gave over\\nthe attempt.\\n\\nI looked at once for Handy Solomon, and was surprised to see him still\\nalive, standing upright on a ledge the other side of the herd. His\\nclothing was literally torn to shreds, and he was covered with blood.\\nBut in this plight he was not alone, for when I turned toward my\\ncompanions they, too, were tattered, torn, and gory. We were a\\ndreadful crew, standing there in the half-light, our chests heaving,\\nour rags dripping red.\\n\\nFor perhaps ten seconds no one moved. Then with a yell of demoniac\\nrage my companions clambered over the rampart of dead seals and\\nattacked the herd.\\n\\nThe seals were now cowed and defenceless. It was a slaughter, and the\\nmost debauching and brutal I have ever known. I had hit out with the\\nrest when it had been a question of defence, but from this I turned\\naside in a sick loathing. The men seemed possessed of devils, and of\\ntheir unnatural energy. Perdosa cast aside the club and took to his\\nnatural weapon, the knife.\\n\\nI can see him yet rolling over and over embracing a big cow, his head\\njammed in an ecstasy of ferocity between the animal\\'s front flippers,\\nhis legs clasped to hold her body, only his right arm rising and\\nfalling as he plunged his knife again and again. She struggled,\\nturning him over and under, wept great tears, and fairly whined with\\nterror and pain. Finally she was still, and Perdosa staggered to his\\nfeet, only to stare about him drunkenly for a moment before throwing\\nhimself with a screech on another victim.\\n\\nThe Nigger alone did not jump into the turmoil. He stood just down\\nthe cave, his club ready. Occasionally a disorganised rush to escape\\nwould be made. The Nigger\\'s lips snarled, and with a truly mad enjoyment\\nhe beat the poor animals back.\\n\\nI pressed against the wall horrified, fascinated, unable either to\\ninterfere or to leave. A close, sticky smell took possession of the\\nair. After a little a tiny stream, growing each moment, began to flow\\npast my feet. It sought its channel daintily, as streamlets do,\\nfeeling among the stones in eddies, quiet pools, miniature falls, and\\nrapids. For the moment I did not realise what it could be. Then the\\nlight caught it down where the Nigger waited, and I saw it was red.\\n\\nAt first the racket of the seals was overpowering. Now, gradually,\\nit was losing volume. I began to hear the blasphemies, ferocious cries,\\nscreams of anger hurled against the cave walls by the men. The thick,\\nsticky smell grew stronger; the light seemed to grow dimmer, as though\\nit could not burn in that fetid air. A seal came and looked up at me,\\nbig tears rolling from her eyes; then she flippered aimlessly away,\\nout of her poor wits with terror. The sight finished me. I staggered\\ndown the length of the black tunnel to the boat.\\n\\nAfter a long interval a little three months\\' pup waddled down to the\\nwater\\'s edge, caught sight of me, and with a squeal of fright dived\\nfar. Poor little devil! I would not have hurt him for worlds. As far\\nas I know this was the only survivor of all that herd.\\n\\nThe men soon appeared, one by one, tired, sleepy-eyed, glutted,\\nwalking in a cat-like trance of satiety. They were blood and tatters\\nfrom head to foot, and from drying red masks peered their bloodshot\\neyes. Not a word said they, but tumbled into the boat, pushed off,\\nand in a moment we were floating in the full sunshine again. We rowed\\nhome in an abstraction. For the moment Berserker rage had burned itself\\nout. Handy Solomon continually wetted his lips, like an animal licking\\nits chops. Thrackles stared into space through eyes drugged with\\nkilling. No one spoke.\\n\\nWe landed in the cove, and were surprised to find it in shadow. The\\nafternoon was far advanced. Over the hill we dragged ourselves, and\\ndown to the spring. There the men threw themselves flat and drank in\\ngreat gulps until they could drink no more. We built a fire, but the\\nNigger refused to cook.\\n\\n\"Someone else turn,\" he growled, \"I cook aboard ship.\"\\n\\nPerdosa, who had hewed the fuel, at once became angry.\\n\\n\"I cut heem de wood!\" he said, \"I do my share; eef I cut heem de wood\\nyou mus\\' cook heem de grub!\"\\n\\nBut the Nigger shook his head, and Perdosa went into an ecstasy of\\nrage. He kicked the fire to pieces; he scattered the unburned wood\\nup and down the beach; he even threw some of it into the sea.\\n\\n\"Eef you no cook heem de grub, you no hab my wood!\" he shrieked, with\\nenough oaths to sink his soul.\\n\\nFinally Pulz interfered.\\n\\n\"Here you damn foreigners,\" said he, \"quit it! Let up, I say! We got\\nto eat. You let that wood alone, or you\\'ll pick it up again!\"\\n\\nPerdosa sprang at him with a screech. Pulz was small but nimble, and\\nunderstood rough and tumble fighting. He met Perdosa\\'s rush with two\\nswift blows--a short arm jab and an upper-cut. Then they clinched,\\nand in a moment were rolling over and over just beyond the wash of\\nthe surf.\\n\\nThe row waked the Nigger from his sullen abstraction. He seemed to\\ncome to himself with a start; his eye fell surprisedly on the\\ncombatants, then lit up with an unholy joy. He drew his knife and\\ncrept down on the fighters. It was too good an opportunity to pay off\\nthe Mexican.\\n\\nBut Thrackles interfered sharply.\\n\\n\"Come off!\" he commanded. \"None o\\' that!\"\\n\\n\"Go to hell!\" growled the Nigger.\\n\\nA great rage fell on them all, blind and terrible, like that leading\\nto the slaughter of the seals. They fought indiscriminately, hitting\\nat each other with fists and knives. It was difficult to tell who was\\nagainst whom. The sound of heavy breathing, dull blows, the tear of\\ncloth; and grunts of punishment received; the swirl of the sand, the\\nheave of struggling bodies, all riveted my attention, so that I did\\nnot see Captain Ezra Selover until he stood almost at my elbow.\\n\"Stop!\" he shrieked in his high, falsetto voice.\\n\\nAnd would you believe it, even through the blood haze of their combat\\nthe men heard him, and heeded. They drew reluctantly apart, got to\\ntheir feet, stood looking at him through reeking brows half submissive\\nand half defiant. The bull-headed Thrackles even took a half step\\nforward, but froze in his tracks when Old Scrubs looked at him.\\n\\n\"I hire you men to fight when I tell you to, and only then,\" said the\\ncaptain sternly. \"What does this mean?\"\\n\\nHe menaced them one after another with his eyes, and one after another\\nthey quailed. All their plottings, their threats, their dangerousness\\ndissipated like mist before the command of this one resolute man.\\nThese pirates who had seemed so dreadful to me, now were nothing more\\nthan cringing schoolboys before their master.\\n\\nAnd then suddenly to my horror I, watching closely, saw the captain\\'s\\neye turn blank. I am sure the men must have felt the change, though\\ncertainly they were too far away to see it, for they shifted by ever\\nso little from their first frozen attitude. The captain\\'s hand sought\\nhis pocket, and they froze again, but instead of the expected\\nrevolver, he produced a half-full brandy bottle.\\n\\nThe change in his eyes had crept into his features. They had turned\\nfoolishly amiable, vacant, confiding.\\n\\n\"\\'llo boys,\" said he appealingly, \"you good fellowsh, ain\\'t you? Have\\na drink. \\'S good stuff. Good ol\\' bottl\\',\" he lurched, caught himself,\\nand advanced toward them, still with the empty smile.\\n\\nThey stared at him for ten seconds, quite at a loss. Then:\\n\\n\"By God, he\\'s drunk!\" Handy Solomon breathed, scarcely louder than\\na whisper.\\n\\nThere was no other signal given. They sprang as with a single impulse.\\nOne instant I saw clear against the waning daylight the bulky,\\nfoolish-swaying form of Captain Selover: the next it had disappeared,\\ncarried down and obliterated by the rush of attacking bodies. Knives\\ngleamed ruddy in the sunset. There was no struggle. I heard a deep\\ngroan. Then the murderers rose slowly to their feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nI MAKE MY ESCAPE\\n\\n\\nI had plenty of time to run away. I do not know why I did not do so;\\nbut the fact stands that I remained where I was until they had\\nfinished Captain Selover. Then I took to my heels, but was soon\\ncornered. I drew my revolver, remembered that I had emptied it in the\\nseal cave--and had time for no more coherent mental processes. A\\nsmothering weight flung itself on me, against which I struggled as\\nhard as I could, shrinking in anticipation from the thirsty plunge\\nof the knives. However, though the weight increased until further\\nstruggle was impossible, I was not harmed, and in a few moments found\\nmyself, wrists and ankles tied, beside a roaring fire. While I\\ncollected myself I heard the grate of a boat being shoved off from\\nthe cove, and a few moments later made out lights aboard the _Laughing\\nLass_.\\n\\nThe looting party returned very shortly. Their plundering had gone\\nonly as far as liquor and arms. Thrackles let down from the cliff top\\na keg at the end of a line. Perdosa and the Nigger each carried an\\narmful of the 30-40 rifles. The keg was rolled to the fire and\\nbroached.\\n\\nThe men got drunk, wildly drunk, but not helplessly so. A flame\\ncommunicated itself to them through the liquor. The ordinary\\ncharacteristics of their composition sprung into sharper relief. The\\nNigger became more sullen; Perdosa more snake-like; Pulz more\\nviciously evil; Thrackles more brutal; while Handy Solomon staggering\\nfrom his seat to the open keg and back again, roaring fragments of\\na chanty, his red headgear contrasting with his smoky black hair and\\nhis swarthy hook-nosed countenance--he needed no further touch.\\n\\nTheir evil passions were all awake, and the plan, so long indefinite,\\ndeveloped like a photographer\\'s plate.\\n\\n\"That\\'s one,\" said Thrackles. \"One gone to hell.\"\\n\\n\"And now the diamonds,\" muttered Pulz.\\n\\n  \"There\\'s a ship upon the windward, a wreck upon the lee,\\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_,\"\\n\\nroared Handy Solomon. \"Damn it all, boys, it\\'s the best night\\'s work\\nwe ever did. The stuff\\'s ours. Then it\\'s me for a big stone house in\\nFrisco O!\"\\n\\n\"Frisco, hell,\" sneered Pulz, \"that\\'s all you know. You ought to\\ntravel. Paris for me and a little gal to learn the language from.\"\\n\\n\"I get heem a fine _caballo_, an\\' fine saddle, an\\' fine clo\\'s,\"\\nbreathed Perdosa sentimentally. \"I ride, and the silver jingle, and\\nthe _señorita_ look----\"\\n\\nThrackles was for a ship and the China trade.\\n\\n\"What you want, Doctor?\" they demanded of the silent Nigger.\\n\\nBut the Nigger only rolled his eyes and shook his head. By and by he\\narose and disappeared in the dusk and was no more seen.\\n\\n\"Dam\\' fool,\" muttered Handy Solomon. \"Well, here\\'s to crime!\"\\n\\nHe drank a deep cup of the raw rum, and staggered back to his seat\\non the sands.\\n\\n  \"\\'I am not a man-o\\'-war, nor a privateer,\\' said he.\\n      _Blow high, blow low! What care we_!\\n  \\'But I am a jolly pirate and I\\'m sailing for my fee,\\'\\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_.\"\\n\\nhe sang. \"We\\'ll land in Valparaiso and we\\'ll go every man his way;\\nand we\\'ll sink the old _Laughing Lass_ so deep the mermaids can\\'t\\nfind her.\"\\n\\nThrackles piled on more wood and the fire leaped high.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s get after \\'em,\\' said he.\\n\\n\"To-morrow\\'s jes\\' \\'s good,\" muttered Pulz. \"Les\\' hav\\' \\'nother drink.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll stay here \\'n see if our ol\\' frien\\' Percy don\\' show up,\" said\\nHandy Solomon. He threw back his head and roared forth a volume of\\nsound toward the dim stars.\\n\\n  \"Broadside to broadside the gallant ships did lay,\\n      _Blow high, blow low! What care we_?\\n  \\'Til the jolly man-o\\'-war shot the pirate\\'s mast away,\\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_.\"\\n\\nI saw near me a live coal dislodged from the fire when Thrackles had\\nthrown on the armful of wood. An idea came to me. I hitched myself\\nto the spark, and laid across it the rope with which my wrists were\\ntied. This, behind my back, was not easy to accomplish, and twice I\\nburned my wrists before I succeeded.\\n\\nFortunately I was at the edge of illumination, and behind the group.\\nI turned over on my side so that my back was toward the fire. Then\\nrapidly I cast loose my ankle lashings. Thus I was free, and selecting\\na moment when universal attention was turned toward the rum barrel,\\nI rolled over a sand dune, got to my hands and knees, and crept away.\\n\\nThrough the coarse grass I crept thus, to the very entrance of the\\narroyo, then rose to my feet. In the middle distance the fire leaped\\nred. Its glow fell intermittently on the surges rolling in. The men\\nstaggered or lay prone, either as gigantic silhouettes or as\\ntatterdemalions painted by the light. The keg stood solid and\\nsubstantial, the hub about which reeled the orgy. At the edge of the\\nwash I could make out something prone, dim, limp, thrown constantly\\nin new positions of weariness as the water ebbed and flowed beneath\\nit, now an arm thrown out, now cast back, as though Old Scrubs slept\\nfeverishly. The drunkards were getting noisy. Handy Solomon still\\nreeled off the verses of, his song. The others joined in, frightfully\\noff the key; or punctuated the performance by wild staccato yells.\\n\\n  \"Their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea,\\n      _Blow high, blow low! What care we_?\\n  And the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea,\\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e,_\"\\n\\nbellowed Handy Solomon.\\n\\nI turned and plunged into the cool darkness of the cañon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nAN ADVENTURE IN THE NIGHT\\n\\n\\nTen seconds after entering the arroyo I was stumbling along in an\\nabsolute blackness. It almost seemed to me that I could reach out my\\nhands and touch it, as one would touch a wall. Or perhaps not exactly\\nthat, for a wall is hard, and this darkness was soft and yielding,\\nin the manner of enveloping hangings. Directly above me was a narrow,\\njagged, and irregular strip of sky with stars. I splashed in the\\nbrook, finding its waters strangely warm, rustled through the grasses,\\nmy head back, chin out, hands extended as one makes his way through\\na house at night. There were no sounds except the tinkle of the\\nsulphurous stream: successive bends in the cañon wall had shut off\\neven the faintest echoes of the bacchanalia on the beach.\\n\\nThe way seemed much longer than by daylight. Already in my calculation\\nI had traversed many times the distance, when, with a jump at the\\nheart, I made out a glow ahead, and in front of it the upright logs\\nof the stockade.\\n\\nTo my surprise the gate was open. I ascended the gentle slope to the\\nvalley\\'s level--and stumbled over a man lying prostrate, shivering\\nviolently, and moaning.\\n\\nI bent over to discover whom it might be. As I did so a brilliant\\nlight seemed to fill the valley, throwing an illumination on the man\\nat my feet. I saw it was the Nigger, and perceived at the same instant\\nthat he was almost beside himself with terror. His eyes rolled, his\\nteeth chattered, his frame contracted in a strong convulsion, and the\\nblack of his complexion had faded to a washed-out dirty grey,\\nrevolting to contemplate. He felt my touch and sprang to his feet,\\nclutching me by the shoulder as a man clutching rescue.\\n\\n\"My Gawd!\" he shivered. \"Look! Dar it is again!\"\\n\\nHe fell to pattering in a tongue unknown to me--charms, spells,\\nundoubtedly, to exorcise the devils that had hold of him. I followed\\nthe direction of his gaze, and myself cried out.\\n\\nThe doctor\\'s laboratory stood in plain sight between the two columns\\nof steam blown straight upward through the stillness of the evening.\\nIt seemed bursting with light. Every little crack leaked it in\\ngenerous streams, while the main illumination appeared fairly to bulge\\nthe walls outward. This was in itself nothing extraordinary, and\\nindicated only the activity of those within, but while I looked an\\nirregular patch of incandescence suddenly splashed the cliff opposite.\\nFor a single instant the very substance of the rock glowed white hot;\\nthen from the spot a shower of spiteful flakes shot as from a\\npyrotechnic, and the light was blotted out as suddenly as it came.\\nAt the same moment it appeared at another point, exhibited the same\\nphenomena, died, flashed out at still a third place, and so was\\nrepeated here and there with bewildering rapidity until the walls of\\nthe valley crackled and spat sparks. Abruptly the darkness fell.\\n\\nAs abruptly it was broken again by a similar exhibition; only this\\ntime the fire was blue. Blue was followed by purple, purple by red.\\nThen ensued the briefest possible pause, in which a figure moved\\nacross the bars of light escaping through the chinks of the\\nlaboratory, and then the whole valley blazed with patches of\\nvari-coloured fire. It was not a reflection: it was actual physical\\nconflagration of the solid rock, in irregular areas. Some of the fire\\nshapes were most fantastic. And with the unexpectedness of a bursting\\nshell the surface of the ground before our feet crackled into a\\nghastly blue flame.\\n\\nThe Nigger uttered a cry in his throat and disappeared. I felt a sharp\\nbreath on my neck, an ejaculation of surprise at my very ear. It was\\nstartling enough to scare the soul out of a man, but I held fast and\\nwas just about to step forward, when my collar was twisted tight from\\nbehind. I raised both hands, felt steel, and knew that I was in the\\ngrasp of Handy Solomon\\'s claw.\\n\\nThe sailor had me foul. I did my best to twist around, to unbutton\\nthe collar, but in vain. I felt my wind leaving me, the ghastly blue\\nlight was shot with red. Distinctly I heard the man\\'s sharp intaken\\nbreath as some new phenomenon met his eye, and his great oath as he\\nswore. \"By the mother of God!\" he cried, \"it\\'s the devil.\"\\n\\nThen I was jerked off my feet, and the next I knew I was lying on my\\nback, very wet, on the beach; the day was breaking, and the men, quite\\nsober, were talking vehemently.\\n\\nIt was impossible to make out what they said, but as Handy Solomon\\nand the Nigger were the centre of discussion, I could imagine the subject.\\nI felt very stiff and sore and hazy in my mind. My neck was lame from\\nthe dragging and my tongue dry from the choking. For some time I lay\\nin a half-torpor watching the lilac of dawn change to the rose of\\nsunrise, utterly indifferent to everything. They had thrown me down\\nacross the first rise of the little sand dunes back of the tide sands,\\nand from it I could at once look out over the sea full of the restless\\nshadows of dawn, and the land narrowing to the mouth of the arroyo.\\nI remember wondering whether Captain Selover were up yet. Then with\\na sharp stab at the heart I remembered.\\n\\nThe thought was like a dash of cold water in clearing my faculties.\\nI raised my head. Seaward a white gull had caught the first rays of\\nthe sun beyond the cliffs. Landward--I saw with a choke in my throat--a\\nfigure emerging from the arroyo.\\n\\nAt the sight I made a desperate attempt to move, but with the effort\\ndiscovered that I was again bound. My stirring thus called Pulz\\'s\\nattention. Before I could look away he had followed the direction of\\nmy gaze. The discussion instantly ceased. They waited in grim silence.\\n\\nI did not know what to do. Percy Darrow, carrying some sort of large\\nbook, was walking rapidly toward us. Perdosa had disappeared.\\nThrackles after an instant came and sat beside me and clapped his big\\nhand over my mouth. It was horrible.\\n\\nWhen within a hundred paces or so, I could see that Darrow laboured\\nunder some great excitement. His usual indifferent saunter had, as\\nI have indicated, given way to a firm and decided step; his ironical\\neye glistened; his sallow cheek glowed.\\n\\n\"Boys,\" he shouted cheerfully. \"The time\\'s up. We\\'ve succeeded. We\\'ll\\nsail just as soon as the Lord\\'ll let us get ready. Rustle the stuff\\naboard. The doctor\\'ll be down in a short time, and we ought to be\\nloaded by night.\"\\n\\nHandy Solomon and Pulz laid hand on two of the rifles near by and\\nbegan surreptitiously to fill their magazines. The Nigger shook his\\nknife free of the scabbard and sat with it in his left hand, concealed\\nby his body. I could feel Thrackles\\'s muscles stiffen. Another fifty\\npaces and it would be no longer necessary to stop my mouth.\\n\\nThe thought made me desperate. I had failed as a leader of these men,\\nand I had been forced to stand by at debauching, cruel, and murderous\\naffairs, but now it is over I thank Heaven the reproach cannot be made\\nagainst me that at any time I counted the consequences to myself.\\nThrackles\\'s hand lay heavy across my mouth. I bit it to the bone, and\\nas he involuntarily snatched it away, I rolled over toward the sea.\\n\\nThus for an instant I had my mouth free. \"Run! Run!\" I shouted. \"For\\nGod\\'s sake----\"\\n\\nThrackles leaped upon me and struck me heavily upon the mouth, then\\nsprang for a rifle. I managed to struggle back to the dune, whence\\nI could see.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV\\n\\nFIVE HUNDRED YARDS\\' RANGE\\n\\n\\nPercy Darrow, with the keenness that always characterised his mental\\napprehension, had understood enough of my strangled cry. He had not\\nhesitated nor delayed for an explanation, but had turned track and\\nwas now running as fast as his long legs would carry him back toward\\nthe opening of the ravine. My companions stood watching him, but making\\nno attempt either to shoot or to follow. For a moment I could not\\nunderstand this, then remembered the disappearance of Perdosa. My\\nheart jumped wildly, for the Mexican had been gone quite long enough\\nto have cut off the assistant\\'s escape. I could not doubt that he\\nwould pick off his man at close range as soon as the fugitive should\\nhave reached the entrance to the arroyo.\\n\\nThere can be no question that he would have done so had not his\\nMexican impatience betrayed him. He shot too soon. Percy Darrow\\nstopped in his tracks. Although we heard the bullet sing by us, for\\nan instant we thought he was hit. Then Perdosa fired a second time,\\nagain without result. Darrow turned sharp to the left and began desperately\\nto scale the steep cliffs.\\n\\nI once took part in a wild boar hunt on the coast of California. Our\\ndogs had penned a small band at the head of a narrow _barranca_,\\nfrom which a single steep trail led over the hill. We, perched on\\nanother hill some three or four hundred yards away, shot at the\\nanimals as they toiled up the trail. The range was long, but we had\\ntime, for the severity of the climb forced the boars to a foot pace.\\n\\nIt was exactly like that. Percy Darrow had two hundred feet of ascent\\nto make. He could go just so fast; must consume just so much time in\\nhis snail-like progress up the face of the hill. During that time he\\nfurnished an excellent target, and the loose sandstone showed where\\neach shot struck.\\n\\nA significant indication was that the men did not take the trouble\\nto get nearer, for which manoeuvre they would have had time in plenty,\\nbut distributed themselves leisurely for a shooting match.\\n\\n\"First shot,\" claimed Handy Solomon, and without delay fired off-hand.\\nA puff of dust showed to the right. \"Nerve no good,\" he commented,\\n\"jerked her just as I pulled.\"\\n\\nPulz fired from the knee. The dust this time puffed below.\\n\\n\"Thought she\\'d carry up at that distance,\" he muttered.\\n\\nThe Nigger, too, missed, and Thrackles grinned triumphantly.\\n\\n\"I get a show,\" said he. He spread his massive legs apart, drew a deep\\nbreath, and raised his weapon. It lay in his grasp steady as a log,\\nand I saw that Percy Darrow\\'s fate was in the hands of that dangerous\\nclass of natural marksman that possesses no nerves. But for the second\\ntime my teeth saved his life. The trigger guard slipped against\\nThrackles\\'s lacerated hand almost at the instant of discharge. He\\nmissed; and the bullet went wide.\\n\\nDarrow had climbed a matter of twenty feet.\\n\\nNow the seamen distributed themselves for more leisurely and accurate\\nmarksmanship. Handy Solomon lay flat on his stomach, resting the rifle\\nmuzzle across the top of a sand dune. Pulz sat down, an elbow on\\neither knee for the greater steadiness. The Nigger knelt; but\\nThrackles remained on his feet. No rest could be steadier than the\\nstone-like rigidity of his thick arms.\\n\\nThe firing now became miscellaneous. No one paid any attention to\\nanyone else. Each discovered what I could have told them, that even\\nthe human figure at five hundred yards is a small mark for a strange\\nrifle. The constant correction of elevation, however, brought the\\npuffs of dust always closer, and I could not but realise that the\\ndoctrine of chances must bring home some of the bullets. I soon\\ndiscovered by way of comfort that only Thrackles and Handy Solomon\\nreally understood firearms; and of those two Thrackles alone had had\\nmuch experience at long range. He told me afterward he had hunted\\notter.\\n\\nAbout halfway up the cliff Thrackles fired his fifth shot. No dust\\nfollowed the discharge; and I saw Percy Darrow stagger and almost lose\\nhis hold. The men yelled savagely, but the assistant pulled himself\\ntogether and continued his crawling.\\n\\nThe sun had been shining in our faces. I could imagine its blurring\\neffect on the sights. Now abruptly it was blotted out, and a\\nsemi-twilight fell. We all looked up, in spite of ourselves. An opaque\\nveil had been drawn quite across the heavens, through which we could\\nnot make out even the shape of the sun. It was like a thunder cloud\\nexcept that its under surface instead of being the usual grey-black\\nwas a deep earth-brown. As we looked up, a deep bellow stirred the air,\\nwhich had fallen quite still, long forks of lightning shot\\nhorizontally from the direction of the island\\'s interior, and flashes\\nof dull red were reflected from the canopy of cloud.\\n\\nThe men stared with their mouths open. Undoubtedly the change had been\\nsome time in preparation, but all had been so absorbed in the affair\\nof the doctor\\'s assistant that no one had noticed. It came to our\\nconsciousness with the suddenness of a theatrical change. A dull\\nroaring commenced, grew in volume, and then a great explosion shook\\nthe very ground under our feet.\\n\\nWe stared at each other, our faces whitening.\\n\\n\"What kind of hell has broke loose?\" muttered Pulz.\\n\\nThe Nigger fell flat on his face, uttering deep lamentations.\\n\\n\"Voodoo! Voodoo!\" he groaned.\\n\\nA gentle shower of white flakes began, powdering the surface of\\neverything. Far out to sea we could make out the sun on the water.\\nGradually the roaring died down; the lightning ceased. Comparative\\npeace ensued. We looked again toward the cliff. Percy Darrow had not\\nfor one instant ceased to climb. He was just topping the edge of the\\nbluff. Handy Solomon, with a cry of rage, seized another rifle and\\nemptied the magazine at him as fast as the lever could be worked. The\\ndust flew wild in a half dozen places. Darrow drew himself up to the\\nsky line, raised his hat ironically, and disappeared.\\n\\n[Illustration: The firing now became miscellaneous. No one paid any\\nattention to any one else.]\\n\\n\"Damn his soul!\" cried Handy Solomon, his face livid. He threw his\\nrifle to the beach and danced on it in an ecstasy of rage.\\n\\n\"What do we care,\" growled Thrackles, \"he\\'s no good to us. W\\'at I want\\nto know is, wat\\'s up here, anyhow!\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you never see a volcano go off, you swab?\" snapped Handy\\nSolomon.\\n\\n\"Easy with your names, mate. No, I never did. We better get out.\"\\n\\n\"Without the chest?\"\\n\\n\"S\\'pose we go up the gulch and get it, then,\" suggested Thrackles.\\n\\nBut at this Handy Solomon drew back in evident terror.\\n\\n\"Up that hole of hell?\" he objected. \"Not I. You an\\' Pulz go.\"\\n\\nThey wrangled over it, Pulz joining. Perdosa, shaken to the soul,\\ncrept in, and made a bee-line for the rum barrel. He and the Nigger\\nwere frankly scared. They had the nervous jumps at every little noise\\nor unexpected movement; and even the natural explanation of these\\nphenomena gave them very little reassurance. I knew that Darrow would\\nhurry as fast as he could back to the valley by way of the upper\\nhills; I knew that he had there several sporting rifles; and I hoped\\ngreatly that he and Dr. Schermerhorn might accomplish something before\\nthe men had recovered their wits to the point of foreseeing his\\nprobable attack. The uncanny cloud in the heavens, the weird\\nhalf-light, and the explosions, which now grew more frequent, had\\ntheir strong effect in spite of explanation. The men were not really\\nafraid to venture in quest of the supposed treasure; but they were in\\na frame of mind that dreaded the first plunge. And time was going by.\\n\\nBut the fates were against us, as always in this ill-starred voyage.\\nI, watching from my sand dune, saw a second figure emerge from the\\narroyo\\'s mouth. It appeared to stagger as though hurt; and every eight\\nor ten paces it stopped and rested in a bent-over position. The murky\\nlight was too dim for me to make out details; but after a moment a\\nrift in the veil enabled me to identify Dr. Schermerhorn carrying,\\nwith great difficulty, the chest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI\\n\\nTHE MURDER\\n\\n\\nI took no chances, but began at once to shout, as soon as I saw the men\\nhad noticed his coming. It was impossible for me to tell whether or not\\nDr. Schermerhorn heard me. If he did, he misunderstood my intention, for\\nhe continued painfully to advance. The only result I gained was to get\\nmyself well gagged with my own pocket handkerchief, and thrown in a hollow\\nbetween the dunes. Thence I could hear Handy Solomon speaking fiercely and\\nrapidly.\\n\\n\"Now you let me run this,\" he commanded; \"we got to find out somethin\\'. It\\nain\\'t no good to us without we knows--and we want to find out how he\\'s got\\nthe rest hid.\"\\n\\nThey assented.\\n\\n\"I\\'m goin\\' out to help him carry her in,\" announced the seaman.\\n\\nA long pause ensued, in which I watched the deep canopy of red-black\\nthicken overhead. A strange and unearthly light had fallen on the world,\\nand the air was quite still. After a while I heard Handy Solomon and Dr.\\nSchermerhorn join the group.\\n\\n\"There you are, Perfessor,\" cried Handy Solomon, in tones of the greatest\\nheartiness, \"I\\'ll put her right there, and she\\'ll be as safe as a babby at\\nhome. She\\'s heavy, though.\"\\n\\nDr. Schermerhorn laughed a pleased and excited laugh. I could tell by the\\ntone of his voice that he was strung high, and guessed that his triumph\\nneeded an audience.\\n\\n\"You may say so well!\" he said. \"It iss heafy; and it iss heafy with the\\nworld-desire, the great substance than can do efferything. Where iss\\nPercy?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s gone aboard.\"\\n\\n\"We must embark. The time is joost right. A day sooner and the egsperiment\\nwould haf been spoilt; but now\"--he laughed--\"let the island sink, we do\\nnot care. We must embark hastily.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'ll take a man long time to carry down all your things, Perfessor.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, led them go! The eruption has alretty swallowed them oop. The lava\\niss by now a foot deep in the valley. Before long it flows here, so we\\nmust embark.\"\\n\\n\"But you\\'ve lost all them vallyable things, Perfessor,\" said Handy\\nSolomon. \"Now, I call that hard luck.\"\\n\\nDr. Schermerhorn snapped his fingers.\\n\\n\"They do not amoundt to that!\" he cried. \"Here, here, in this leetle box\\niss all the treasure! Here iss the labour of ten years! Here iss the\\n_Laughing Lass_, and the crew, and all the equipmendt comprised. Here iss\\nthe world!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m a plain seaman, Perfessor, and I suppose I got to believe you; but\\nshe\\'s a main small box for all that.\"\\n\\n\"With that small box you can haf all your wishes,\" asserted the Professor,\\nstill in the German lyric strain over his triumph. \"It iss the box of\\nenchantments. You haf but to will the change you would haf taig place--it\\niss done. The substance of the rocks, the molecule--all!\"\\n\\n\"Could a man make diamonds?\" asked Pulz abruptly. I could hear the sharp\\nintake of the men\\'s breathing as they hung on the reply.\\n\\n\"Much more wonderful changes than that it can accomplish,\" replied the\\ndoctor, with an indulgent laugh. \"That change iss simple. Carbon iss coal;\\ncarbon iss diamond. You see? One has but to change the form, not the\\nsubstance.\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'ll change coal to diamonds?\" asked Handy Solomon.\\n\\n\"Yes, you gather my meanings--\"\\n\\nI heard a sharp squeak like a terrified mouse. Then a long, dreadful\\nsilence; then two dull, heavy blows, spaced with deliberation. A moment\\nlater I caught a glimpse of Handy Solomon bent forward to the labour of\\ndragging a body toward the sea, his steel claw hooked under the angle of\\nthe jaw as a man handles a fish. Pulz came and threw off my bonds and gag.\\n\\n\"Come along!\" said he.\\n\\nAll kept looking fearfully toward the arroyo. A dense white steam marked\\nits course. The air was now heavy with portent. Successive explosions,\\nsome light, some severe, shook the foundations of the island. Great rocks\\nand boulders bounded down the hills. The flashes of lightning had become\\nmore frequent. We moved, exaggerated to each other\\'s vision by the strange\\nlight, uncouth and gigantic.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s get out of this!\" cried Thrackles.\\n\\nWe turned at the word and ran, Thrackles staggering under the weight of\\nthe chest. All our belongings we abandoned, and set out for the _Laughing\\nLass_ with only the tatters in which we stood. Luckily for us a great part\\nof the ship\\'s stores had been returned to her hold after the last thorough\\nscrubbing, so we were in subsistence, but all our clothes, all our\\npersonal belongings, were left behind us on the beach. For after once we\\nhad topped the cliff that led over to the cove, I doubt if any\\nconsideration on earth would have induced us to return to that accursed\\nplace.\\n\\nThe row out to the ship was wet and dangerous. Seismic disturbances were\\nundoubtedly responsible for high pyramidic waves that lifted and fell\\nwithout onward movement. We fairly tumbled up out of the dory, which we\\ndid not hoist on deck, but left at the end of the painter to beat her\\nsides against the ship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII\\n\\nTHE OPEN SEA\\n\\n\\nOur haste, however, availed us little, for there was no wind at all. We\\nlay for over two hours under the weird light, over-canopied by the red-\\nbrown cloud, while the explosions shook the foundations of the world.\\nNobody ventured below. The sails flapped idly from the masts: the blocks\\nand spars creaked: the three-cornered waves rose straight up and fell\\nagain as though reaching from the deep.\\n\\nWhen the men first began to sweat the sails up, evidently in preparation\\nfor an immediate departure, I objected vehemently.\\n\\n\"You aren\\'t going to leave him on the island,\" I cried. \"He\\'ll die of\\nstarvation.\"\\n\\nThey did not answer me; but after a little more, when my expostulations\\nhad become more positive, Handy Solomon dropped the halliard, and drew me\\nto one side.\\n\\n\"Look here, you,\" he snarled, \"you\\'d better just stow your gab. You\\'re\\nlucky to be here yourself, let alone botherin\\' your thick head about\\nanybody else, and you can kiss the Book on that! Do you know why you ain\\'t\\nwith them carrion?\" He jerked his thumb toward the beach. \"It\\'s because\\nSolomon Anderson\\'s your friend. Thrackles would have killed you in a\\nminute \\'count of his bit hand. I got you your chance. Now don\\'t you be a\\nfool, for I ain\\'t goin\\' to stand between you and them another time.\\nBesides, he won\\'t last long if that volcano keeps at it.\"\\n\\nHe left me. Whatever truth lay in his assumption of friendship, and I\\ndoubted there existed much of either truth or friendship in him, I saw the\\ncommon sense of his advice. I was in no position to dictate a course of\\naction.\\n\\nAfter the sails were on her we gathered at the starboard rail to watch the\\nshore. There the hills ran into inky blackness, as the horizon sometimes\\nmerges into a thunder squall. A dense white steam came from the creek bed\\nwithin the arroyo. The surges beat on the shore louder than the ordinary,\\nand the foam, even in these day hours, seemed to throw up a faint\\nphosphorescence. Frequent earthquakes oscillated the landscape. We\\nwatched, I do not know for what, our eyes straining into the murk of the\\nisland. Nobody thought of the chest, which lay on the cabin table aft. I\\ncontributed maliciously my bit to their fear.\\n\\n\"These volcanic islands sometimes sink entirely,\" I suggested, \"and in\\nthat case we\\'d be carried down by the suction.\"\\n\\nIt was intended merely to increase their uneasiness, but, strangely\\nenough, after a few moments it ended by imposing itself on my own fears. I\\nbegan to be afraid the island would sink, began to watch for it, began to\\nshare the fascinated terror of these men.\\n\\nThe suspense after a time became unbearable, for while the portent--\\nwhether physical or moral we were too far under its influence to\\ndistinguish--grew momentarily, our own souls did not expand in due\\ncorrespondence. We talked of towing, of kedging out, of going to any\\nextreme, even to small boats. Then just as we were about to move toward\\nsome accomplishment, a new phenomenon chained our attention to the shore.\\n\\nIn the mouth of the arroyo appeared a red glow. A moment later a wave of\\nlava, white-hot, red, iridescent, cooling to a black crust cracked in\\nincandescence, rolled majestically out over the grassy plain. Each instant\\nit grew in volume, until the ravine must have been flowing half full.\\n\\nBefore its scorching the grasses even at the edge of the sea were smoking,\\nand our camp had already burst into flames. We had to shield our faces\\nagainst the heat, and the wooden railing under our hands was growing warm.\\n\\nPulz turned an ashy countenance toward us.\\n\\n\"My God,\" he screamed. \"What\\'s going to happen when she hits the sea?\"\\n\\nShe hit the sea, and immediately a great cloud of steam arose, and the\\nhissing as of a thousand serpents. We felt the strong suction under our\\nkeel, and staggered under the jerk of the ship\\'s cable as she swung toward\\nthe beach. The paint was beginning to crackle along the rail. We could see\\nnothing for the scalding white veil that enveloped us; we could hear\\nnothing for the roar of steam, the bombardment of explosions, and the\\ncrash of thunder; but our nostrils were assaulted by a most unearthly\\nmedley of smells.\\n\\n\"Hell\\'s loose,\" growled Thrackles.\\n\\nWe were clinging hard as the ship reeled. Huge surges were racing in from\\nseaward, growing larger with each successive billow.\\n\\nHandy Solomon raised his head, listened intently, and struck his forehead.\\n\\n\"Wind,\" he screamed at the top of his voice, and jumped for the halliards.\\n\\nThrackles followed him, but no one else moved. In an instant the two were\\nback, striking and kicking savagely, rousing their companions to the\\ndanger. We all laid into the canvas like mad, and in no time had snugged\\ndown to a staysail and the peak of our mainsail. Thrackles drew his knife\\nand jumped for the cable, while Handy Solomon, his eyes snapping, seized\\nthe wheel.\\n\\nWe finished just in time. I was turning away after tying the last gasket\\non the foresail, when the deck up-ended and tipped me headforemost into\\nthe starboard scupper. At the same time a smother of salt water blew over\\nthe port rail, now far above me, to drench me as thoroughly as though I\\nhad fallen overboard. I brushed out my eyes to find the ship smack on her\\nbeam ends, and the wind howling by from the sea.\\n\\nI had company enough in the scuppers. Only Handy Solomon clung desperately\\nto the wheel, jamming his weight to port in the hope she might pay up:\\nThrackles, too, his eye squinted along some bearing of his own, was\\nwaiting for her to drag. Presently it became evident that she was doing\\nso, whereupon he drew his knife across our hawser.\\n\\n\"My God,\" chattered Pulz at my ear. \"If we go ashore--\"\\n\\nHe did not need to finish. Unless the _Laughing Lass_ could recover before\\nthe squall had driven her to leeward a scant half mile, we should be\\ncooked alive in the boiling cauldron at the shore\\'s edge.\\n\\nFor an interminable time, as it seemed to me, we lay absolutely\\nmotionless. The scene is stamped indelibly on my memory--the bulwarks high\\nabove me, the steep, sleek deck, the piratical figure tense at the wheel,\\nthe snarling water racing from beneath us, the lurid glow to landward\\ncrawling up on us inch by inch like a hungry wild beast. Then almost\\nimperceptibly the brave schooner righted. The strained lines on Handy\\nSolomon\\'s carven features relaxed little by little. Thrackles, staring\\nover the side, let out a mighty roar.\\n\\n\"Steerage way,\" he shouted, and executed an awkward clog dance on the\\nreeling deck.\\n\\nShe moved forward, there was no doubt of that, for gradually we were\\neating toward the wind--but we made considerable leeway as well. Handy\\nSolomon, taut as the weather rigging, took his little advantages one by\\none like precious gifts. Light there was none; the land was blotted out by\\nthe steam and murk which had crept to sea and now was hurled back by the\\nwind. All we could do was to hang there, tasting the copper of excitement,\\nwaiting for these different forces to adjust themselves. Inch by inch we\\ncrept forward: foot by foot we made leeway. The intensest of the lava glow\\nworked its way from directly abeam to the quarter. By this we knew we must\\nbe nearly opposite the cove. At once a new doubt sprang up in our minds.\\n\\nA moment ago all the energy of our desires had gone up in the ambition to\\navoid being cast on the beach. Now we saw that that was not enough. It was\\nnecessary to squeeze around the point where lay the _Golden Horn_, in\\norder to avoid the fate that had overtaken her. Handy Solomon yelled\\nsomething at us. We could not hear, but our own knowledge told us what it\\nmust be, and with one accord we turned to on the foresail. With the peak\\nof it hoisted we moved a trifle faster, though the schooner lay over at a\\nperilous angle. A moment later the fogs parted to show us the cliffs\\nlooming startlingly near. There were the donkey engine and the works we\\nhad constructed for wrecking--and there beside them, watching us\\nreflectively, stood Percy Darrow.\\n\\nFor ten minutes we stared at him fascinated, during which time the ship\\nlaboured against the staggering winds, gained and lost in its buffeting\\nwith the great surges. The breakers hurling themselves in wild abandon\\nagainst the rocks sent their back-wash of tumbling peaks to our very\\nbilges. The few remains of the _Golden Horn_, alternately drenched and\\ndraining, seemed to picture to us our inevitable end.\\n\\nI think we had all selected the same two points for our \"bearings,\" a rock\\nand a drop of the cliff bolder than the ordinary. If the rock opened from\\nthe cliff to eastward, we were lost; if it remained stationary, we were at\\nleast holding our own; if it opened out to westward, we were saved. We\\nwatched with a strained eagerness impossible to describe. At each\\nmomentary gain or rebuff we uttered ejaculations. The Nigger mumbled\\ncharms. Every once in a while one of us would snatch a glance to leeward\\nat the cruel, white waters, the whirl of eddies where the sea was beaten,\\nonly to hurry back to the rock and the point of the cliff whence our\\nmessage of safety or destruction was to be flung. Once I looked up. Percy\\nDarrow was leaning gracefully against a stanchion, watching. His soft hat\\nwas pulled over his eyes; he stroked softly his little moustache; I caught\\nthe white puff of his cigarette. During the moment of my inattention\\nsomething happened. A wild shout burst from the men. I whirled, and saw to\\nmy great joy a strip of sky westward between the cliff and the rock. And\\nat that very instant a billow larger than the ordinary rolled beneath us,\\nand in the back suction of its passage I could dimly make out cruel,\\ndangerous rocks lying almost under our keel.\\n\\nSlowly we crept away. Our progress seemed infinitesimal, and yet it was\\nreal. In a while we had gained sea room; in a while more we were fairly\\nunder sailing way, and the cliffs had begun to drop from our quarter. With\\none accord we looked back. Percy Darrow waved his hand in an indescribably\\ngraceful and ironic gesture; then turned square on his heel and sauntered\\naway to the north valley, out of the course of the lava. That was the last\\nI ever saw of him.\\n\\nAs we made our way from beneath the island, the weight of the wind seemed\\nto lessen. We got the foresail on her, then a standing jib; finally little\\nby little all her ordinary working canvas. Before we knew it, we were\\nbowling along under a stiff breeze, and the island was dropping astern.\\n\\nFrom a distance it presented a truly imposing sight. The centre shot\\nintermittent blasts of ruddy light; explosions, deadened by distance,\\nstill reverberated strongly; the broad canopy of brown-red, split with\\nlightnings, spread out like a huge umbrella. The lurid gloom that had\\nenveloped us in the atmosphere apparently of a nether world had given\\nplace to a twilight. Abruptly we passed from it to a sun-kissed, sparkling\\nsea. The breeze blew sweet and strong; the waves ran untortured in their\\nnatural long courses.\\n\\nAt once the men seemed to throw off the superstitious terror that had\\ncowed them. Pulz and Thrackles went to bail the extra dory, alongside,\\nwhich by a miracle had escaped swamping. The Nigger disappeared in the\\ngalley. Perdosa relieved Handy Solomon at the wheel; and Handy Solomon\\ncame directly over to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII\\n\\nTHE CATASTROPHE\\n\\n\\nHe approached me with a confidence that proclaimed the new leader. A brace\\nof Colt\\'s revolvers swung from his belt, the tatters of his blood-stained\\ngarments hung about him.\\n\\n\"Well, here we are,\" he remarked.\\n\\nI nodded, waiting for what he had to disclose.\\n\\n\"And lucky for you that you\\'re here at all, say I,\" he continued. \"And now\\nthat you\\'re here, w\\'at are you going to do? That\\'s the question--w\\'at are\\nyou going to do?\" He cocked his head sidewise and looked at me\\nspeculatively as a cat might look at a rather large mouse. \"We been a\\nlittle rough,\" he went on after a moment, \"and some folks is strait-laced.\\nThere might be trouble. And you know a heap too much.\"\\n\\n\"What do you want of me?\" I demanded.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just this,\" he returned briskly. \"If you\\'ll lay us our course to San\\nSalvador, we\\'ll let you go as one of us and no questions asked.\"\\n\\n\"If not?\" I inquired.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"I leave it to you.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s always the sea,\" I suggested.\\n\\n\"And it\\'s deep,\" he agreed.\\n\\nWe looked out to the horizon in a diplomatic silence. I did not know\\nwhether to be angry, amused, or alarmed that the man estimated my\\ncleverness so slightly. Why, the hook was barely concealed, and the bait\\nof the coarsest. That I would go safe to a sight of San Salvador I did not\\ndoubt: that I would never enter the harbour I was absolutely certain. The\\nchoice offered me was practically whether I preferred being thrown\\noverboard now or several hundred miles to southeastward.\\n\\nI thought rapidly. It might be possible to announce a daily false\\nreckoning to the crew, to sail the ship within rowing distance of some\\ncoast; and then to escape while the men believed themselves many hundred\\nmiles at sea. It would take nice calculation to prevent suspicion, but as\\nit was the only chance I resolved upon it immediately.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all very well,\" I said firmly, \"but you can\\'t get anywhere without\\nme, and I\\'m not going to put in two years and then keep my mouth shut for\\nnothing. I want a share in the swag--an even share with the rest of you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'ll be all right,\" he cried; \"you can have it.\"\\n\\nIf anything was needed to convince me of the man\\'s sinister intentions,\\nthis too ready acquiescence would have been enough. I knew him too well.\\nIf he had had the slightest intention of permitting me to go free, he\\nwould have bargained.\\n\\nThe Nigger called us to mess. We ate in the after cabin. The chest was\\nlocked and the men had as yet been unable to break into it. Pulz professed\\nsome skill in locksmithing and promised to experiment later. After mess we\\nwent on deck again. The island had dropped down to the horizon and showed\\nas a brilliant glow under a dark canopy. I leaned over the rail looking at\\nit. Below me the extra dory bumped along. The idea came to me that if I\\ncould escape that night, I could row back to Percy Darrow. The two of us\\ncould make shift to live on fish and shellfish and mutton. The plan\\nrapidly defined itself in my brain. From the remains of the _Golden Horn_\\nwe could construct some kind of a craft in which to run free to the summer\\ntrades. Thus we might in time reach some one or another of the Sandwich\\nIslands, whence a passing trader could take us back to civilisation. There\\nwere many elements of uncertainty in the scheme, but it seemed to me less\\ndesperate than trusting to the caprices of these men, especially since\\nthey now had free access to the liquor stores.\\n\\nWhile I leaned over the rail engrossed in these thoughts, one of the black\\nthunder clouds that had been gathering and dissipating over the island\\nduring the entire afternoon suddenly glowed overhead with a strange white\\nincandescence startlingly akin to Darrow\\'s so-called \"devil fires.\"\\nStrangely enough, this illumination, unlike the volcanic glows, appeared\\nto be cast on the clouds from without rather than shot through them from\\nwithin, as were the other volcanic emanations. At the same instant I\\nexperienced a sharp interior revulsion of some sort, most briefly\\nmomentary, but of a character that shook me from head to toe.\\n\\nI had no time to analyse these various impressions, however, for my\\nattention was almost instantly distracted. From the cabin came the sound\\nof a sharp fall, then a man cried out, and on the heels of it Pulz darted\\nfrom the cabin, screaming horribly. We were all on deck, and as the little\\nman rushed toward the stern Handy Solomon twisted him deftly from his\\nfeet.\\n\\n\"My God, mate, what is it?\" he cried, as he pinned the sufferer to the\\ndeck.\\n\\nBut Pulz could not answer. He shivered, stiffened, and lay rigid, his eyes\\nrolled back.\\n\\n\"Fits,\" remarked Thrackles impatiently.\\n\\nThe excitement died. Rum was forced between the victim\\'s lips. After a\\nlittle he recovered, but could tell us nothing of his seizure.\\n\\nAfter the dishes had been swept aside from supper, Handy Solomon announced\\na second attempt to open the chest.\\n\\n\"Pancho, here, says he\\'s been a mechanic,\" said he. \"I right well know\\nhe\\'s been a housebreaker. So he\\'s got the _sabe_ for the job, and you can\\nkiss the Book on that.\"\\n\\nPerdosa, with a grin, leaned over the cover from behind and began to pick\\naway at the lock with a long, crooked wire. The others drew close about. I\\nslipped nearer the door, imagining that in their riveted interest I saw my\\nopportunity. To my surprise I caught a glimpse of legs disappearing up the\\ncompanion. I took stock. Pulz had gone on deck.\\n\\nThis surprised me, for I should have thought every man interested enough\\nin the supposed treasure to wish to be present at its uncovering; and it\\nannoyed me still more--the success of my plan demanded a clear deck.\\nHowever, there was nothing for it now but to trust that Pulz had wished to\\nvisit the forecastle, and that I might find the afterworks empty.\\n\\nI paused at the foot of the companion and looked back. A breathlessness of\\nexcitement held the pirates in a vise. From above, the hanging lamp threw\\nstrong shadows across their faces, bringing out the deep lines,\\naccentuating the dominant passions. With their rags and blood, their\\nunshaven faces, their firearms, their filth, they showed in violent\\nantithesis to the immaculate white of Old Scrubs\\'s cabin, its glittering\\nbrass, and its shining leather. I darted up the steps.\\n\\nThe contrast of the starry night with the glare of the cabin lamp dazzled\\nmy eyes. I stood stock still for a moment, during which the only sounds\\naudible were the singing of the winds through the rigging, the wash of the\\nsea, and the small, sharp click of Perdosa\\'s instrument as he worked at\\nthe chest.\\n\\nPresently I could see better. I looked forward and aft for Pulz, but could\\nsee nothing of him, and had just about concluded that he had gone forward\\nwhen I happened to glance aloft. There, to my astonishment, I made him\\nout, huddled in silhouette against the stars, close to the main truck.\\nWhat he was doing there I could not imagine. However, I did not have time\\nto bother my head about him, further than to rejoice that he could not\\nobstruct me.\\n\\nI should very much have liked to get hold of a rifle and ammunition, or at\\nleast to lay in biscuit and water, but for this there was no time. It was\\nnot absolutely essential. The dull glow of the island was still visible. I\\nhad my pillar of fire and smoke to guide me.\\n\\nWithout further delay I jerked loose the painter and drew the extra dory\\nalongside.\\n\\nI had proceeded just so far in my movements, when the most extraordinary\\nthing happened. I shall try to tell you of it as accurately as possible,\\nand in the exact order of its occurrence. First a long, straight shaft of\\nwhite light shot straight up through the cabin roof to a great height. It\\nshone through the wooden planks as an ordinary light shines through glass.\\nBy contrast the surrounding blackness was thrown into a deeper shade, and\\nyet the shaft itself was so brilliant as almost to scotch the sight.\\nCuriously enough, it was defined accurately, being exactly in shape like\\none of the rectangular tin air-shafts you see so often in city hotels. At\\nthe instant of its appearance, the wind fell quite calm.\\n\\nAlmost immediately the rectangle on the roof through which the light made\\nits passage began to splay out, like lighted oil, although the column\\nretained still the integrity of its outline. The fire, if such it could be\\ncalled, ran with incredible rapidity along the seams between the planks,\\nforward and aft, until the entire deck was sketched like a pyrotechnic\\ndisplay in thin, vivid lines of incandescence. From each of these lines\\nthen the fire began again to spread, as though soaking through the planks.\\n\\nAll took place practically in an instant of time. I had no opportunity to\\nmove nor to cry out; indeed, my perceptions were inadequate to the task of\\nmere observation. Up to now there had been no sound. The wind had fallen;\\nthe waters passed unnoticed. A stillness of death seemed to have descended\\non the ship. It was broken by a sharp double report, one as of the fall of\\na metallic substance, the other caused by the body of Pulz, which, shaken\\nloose from the truck by a heavy roll, smashed against the rail of the ship\\nand splashed overboard. Someone cried out sharply. An instant later the\\nentire crew struggled out from the companionway, rushed in grim silence to\\nthe side of the vessel, and threw themselves into the sea.\\n\\nMy own ideas were somewhat confused. The fire had practically enveloped\\nthe ship. I thought to feel it; and yet my skin was cool to the touch. The\\nship\\'s outlines became blurred. A dizziness overtook me; and then all at\\nonce a great desire seized and shook my very soul. I cannot tell you the\\nvehemence of this desire. It was a madness; nothing could stand in the way\\nof its gratification. Whatever happened, I must have water. It was not\\nthirst, nor yet a purpose to allay the very real physical burning of which\\nI was now dimly conscious; but a craving for the liquid itself as\\nsomething apart from and unconnected with anything else. Without\\nhesitation, and as though it were the most natural thing in the world, I\\nvaulted the rail to cast myself into the ocean. I dimly remember a last\\nflying impression of a furnace of light, then a great shock thudded\\nthrough me, and I lost consciousness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART THREE\\n\\n\\nTHE MAROON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nIN THE WARDROOM\\n\\n\\nOver the wardroom of the _Wolverine_ had fallen a silence. It held after\\nSlade had finished. Captain Parkinson, stiff and erect in his chair,\\nstaring fixedly at a spot two feet above the reporter\\'s head, seemed to\\nweigh, as a judge weighs, the facts so picturesquely, set forth. Dr.\\nTrendon, his sturdy frame half in shadow, had slouched far down into\\nhimself. Only the regard of his keen eyes fixed upon Slade\\'s face,\\nunwaveringly and a bit anxiously, showed that he was thinking of the\\nnarrator as well as of the narrative. The others had fallen completely\\nunder the spell of the tale. They sat, as children in a theatre, absorbed,\\nforgetful of the world around them, wrapped in a more vivid element. At\\nthe close, they stirred and blinked, half dazed by the abrupt fall of the\\ncurtain.\\n\\nSlade had told his story with fire, with something of passion, even. Now\\nhe felt the sharp reflex. He muttered uncertainly beneath his breath and\\nglanced from one to another of the circled faces.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all,\" he said unsteadily.\\n\\nThere passed through the group a stir and a murmur. Someone broke into\\nsharp coughing. Chairs, shoved back, grated on the floor.\\n\\n\"Well, of all the extraordinary--\" began a voice, ruminatingly, and broke\\nshort off, as if abashed at its own infraction of the silence.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all,\" repeated Slade, a note of insistence in his voice. \"Why\\ndon\\'t you say something? Confound you, why don\\'t you say something?\" His\\nspeech rose husky and cracked. \"Don\\'t you believe it?\"\\n\\n\"Hold on,\" said the surgeon quietly. \"No need to get excited.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well,\" muttered the reporter, with a sudden lapse. \"Possibly you\\nthink I\\'m romancing. It doesn\\'t matter. I don\\'t suppose I\\'d believe it\\nmyself, in your place.\"\\n\\n\"But we\\'re heading for the island,\" suggested Forsythe.\\n\\n\"That\\'s so,\" cried Slade. \"Well, that\\'s all right. Believe or disbelieve\\nas much as you like. Only get Percy Darrow off that island. Then we\\'ll\\nhave his version. There are a few things I want to find out about,\\nmyself.\"\\n\\n\"There are several that promise to be fairly interesting,\" said Forsythe,\\nunder his breath.\\n\\nSlade turned to the captain. \"Have you any questions to put to me, sir?\"\\nhe asked formally.\\n\\n\"Just one moment,\" interrupted Trendon. \"Boy, a pony of brandy for Mr.\\nSlade.\"\\n\\nThe reporter drank the liquor and again turned to Captain Parkinson.\\n\\n\"Only about our men,\" said the commanding officer, after a little thought.\\n\\nSlade shook his head.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry I can\\'t help you there, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Trendon said that you knew nothing about Edwards.\"\\n\\n\"Edwards?\" repeated Slade inquiringly. His mind, still absorbed in the\\nevents which he had been relating, groped backward.\\n\\nTrendon came to his aid. \"Barnett asked you about him, you remember. It\\nwas when you recovered consciousness. Our ensign. Took over charge of the\\n_Laughing Lass_.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course. I was a little dazed, I fancy.\"\\n\\n\"We put Mr. Edwards aboard when we first picked up the deserted schooner,\"\\nexplained the captain.\\n\\n\"Pardon me,\" said the other. \"My head doesn\\'t seem to work quite right\\nyet. Just a moment, please.\" He sat silent, with closed eyes. \"You say you\\npicked up the _Laughing Lass_. When?\" he asked presently.\\n\\n\"Four--five--six days ago, the first time.\"\\n\\n\"Then you put out the fire.\"\\n\\nThe circle closed in on Slade, with an unconscious hitching forward of\\nchairs. He had fixed his eyes on the captain. His mouth worked. Obviously\\nhe was under a tensity of endeavour in keeping his faculties set to the\\nproblem. The surgeon watched him, frowning.\\n\\n\"There was no fire,\" said the captain.\\n\\nSlade leaped in his chair. \"No fire! But I saw her, I tell you. When I\\nwent overboard she was one living flame!\"\\n\\n\"You landed in the small boat. Knocked you senseless,\" said Trendon.\\n\"Concussion of the brain. Idea of flame might have been a retroactive\\nhallucination.\"\\n\\n\"Retroactive rot,\" cried the other. \"I beg your pardon, Dr. Trendon. But\\nif you\\'d seen her as I saw her--Barnett!\"\\n\\nHe turned in appeal to his old acquaintance.\\n\\n\"There was no fire, Slade,\" replied the executive officer gently. \"No sign\\nof fire that we could find, except that the starboard rail was blistered.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that was from the volcano,\" said Slade. \"That was nothing.\"\\n\\n\"It was all there was,\" returned Barnett.\\n\\n\"Just let me run this thing over,\" said the free lance slowly. \"You found\\nthe schooner. She wasn\\'t afire. She didn\\'t even seem to have been afire.\\nYou put a crew aboard under your ensign, Edwards. Storm separated you from\\nher. You picked her up again deserted. Is that right?\"\\n\\n\"Day before yesterday morning.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" cried the other excitedly, \"the fire was smouldering all the time.\\nIt broke out and your men took to the water.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible,\" said Barnett.\\n\\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" said the more downright surgeon.\\n\\n\"I hardly think Mr. Edwards would be driven overboard by a fire which did\\nnot even scorch his ship,\" suggested the captain mildly.\\n\\n\"It drove our lot overboard,\" insisted Slade. \"Do you think we were a pack\\nof cowards? I tell you, when that hellish thing broke loose, you had to\\ngo. It wasn\\'t fear. It wasn\\'t pain. It was--What\\'s the use. You can\\'t\\nexplain a thing like that.\"\\n\\n\"We certainly saw the glow the night Billy Edwards was--disappeared,\"\\nmused Forsythe.\\n\\n\"And again, night before last,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that!\" cried Slade. \"Where is the _Laughing Lass_?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d give something pretty to know,\" said Barnett.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t she in tow?\"\\n\\n\"In tow?\" said Forsythe. \"No, indeed. We hadn\\'t adequate facilities for\\ntowing her. Didn\\'t you tell him, Mr. Barnett?\"\\n\\n\"Where is she, then?\" Slade fired the question at them like a cross-\\nexaminer.\\n\\n\"Why, we shipped another crew under Ives and McGuire that noon. We were\\nparted again, and haven\\'t seen them since.\"\\n\\n\"God forgive you!\" said the reporter. \"After the warnings you\\'d had, too.\\nIt was--it was--\"\\n\\n\"My orders, Mr. Slade,\" said Captain Parkinson, with quiet dignity.\\n\\n\"Of course, sir. I beg your pardon,\" returned the other. \"But--you say you\\nsaw the light again?\"\\n\\n\"The first night they were out,\" said Barnett, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Then your second crew is with your first crew,\" said Slade, shakily. \"And\\nthey\\'re with Thrackles, and Pulz and Solomon, and many another black-\\nhearted scoundrel and brave seaman. Down there!\"\\n\\nHe pointed under foot. Captain Parkinson rose and went to his cabin. Slade\\nrose, too, but his knees were unsteady. He tottered, and but for the swift\\naid of Barnett\\'s arm, would have fallen.\\n\\n\"Overdone,\" said Dr. Trendon, with some irritation. \"Cost you something in\\nstrength. Foolish performance. Turn in now.\"\\n\\nSlade tried to protest, but the surgeon would not hear of it, and marched\\nhim incontinently to his berth. Returning, Trendon reported, with growls\\nof discontent, that his patient was in a fever.\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t expect anything else,\" he fumed. \"Pack of human interrogation\\npoints hounding him all over the place.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think of his story?\" asked Forsythe.\\n\\nThe grizzled surgeon drew out a cigar, lighted it, took three deliberate\\npuffs, turned it about, examined the ash end with concentration, and\\nreplied:\\n\\n\"Man\\'s telling a straight story.\"\\n\\n\"You think it\\'s all true?\" cried Forsythe.\\n\\n\"Humph!\" grunted the other. \"_He thinks it\\'s all true_.\"\\n\\nAn orderly appeared and knocked at the captain\\'s cabin.\\n\\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" they heard him say. \"Mr. Carter would like to know how\\nclose in to run. Volcano\\'s acting up pretty bad, sir.\"\\n\\nCaptain Parkinson went on deck, followed by the rest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nTHE JOLLY ROGER\\n\\n\\nFeeling the way forward, the cruiser was soon caught in a maze of cross\\ncurrents. Hither and thither she was borne, a creature bereft of volition.\\nOrder followed order like the rattle of quick-fire, and was obeyed with\\nsomething more than the _Wolverine\\'s_ customary smartness. From the bridge\\nCaptain Parkinson himself directed his ship. His face was placid: his\\nbearing steady and confident. This in itself was sufficient earnest that\\nthe cruiser was in ticklish case. For it was an axiom of the men who\\nsailed under Parkinson that the calmer that nervous man grew, the more\\ncause was there for nervousness on the part of others.\\n\\nThe approach was from the south, but suspicious aspects of the water had\\nfended the cruiser out and around, until now she stood prow-on to a bold\\nheadland at the northwest corner of the island. Above this headland lay a\\ndark pall of vapour. In the shifting breeze it swayed sluggishly, heavily,\\nas if riding at anchor like a logy ship of the air. Only once did it show\\nany marked movement.\\n\\n\"It\\'s spreading out toward us,\" said Barnett to his fellow officers,\\ngathered aft.\\n\\n\"Time to move, then,\" grunted Trendon.\\n\\nThe others looked at him inquiringly.\\n\\n\"About as healthful as prussic acid, those volcanic gases,\" explained the\\nsurgeon.\\n\\nThe ship edged on and inward. Presently the sing-song of the leadsman\\nsounded in measured distinctness through the silence. Then a sudden\\nactivity and bustle forward, the rattle of chains, and the _Wolverine_ was\\nat anchor. The captain came down from the bridge.\\n\\n\"What do you think, Dr. Trendon?\" he asked.\\n\\nMore explicit inquiry was not necessary.\\n\\nThe surgeon understood what was in his superior\\'s mind.\\n\\n\"Never can tell about volcanoes, sir,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" agreed the captain. \"But--well, do you recognise any of the\\nsymptoms?\"\\n\\n\"Want me to diagnose a case of earthquake, sir?\" grinned Trendon. \"She\\nmight go off to-day, or she might behave herself for a century.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s all chance,\" said the other, cheerfully. \"The man _might_ be\\nalive. At any rate we must do our best on that theory. What do you make of\\nthat cloud on the peak?\"\\n\\n\"Poisonous vapours, I suppose. Thought we\\'d have a chance to make sure\\njust now. Seemed to be coming right for us. Wind\\'s shifted it since.\"\\n\\n\"There couldn\\'t be anything alive up there?\"\\n\\n\"Not so much as a bug,\" replied the doctor positively.\\n\\n\"Yet I thought when the vapour lifted a bit that I saw something moving.\"\\n\\n\"When was that, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Ten or fifteen minutes back.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see soon enough, sir,\" put in Forsythe. \"The wind is driving it\\ndown to the south\\'ard.\"\\n\\nSullenly, reluctantly, the forbidding mass moved across the headland. All\\nglasses were bent upon it. Without taking his binocular from his eyes,\\nTrendon began to ruminate aloud.\\n\\n\"If he could have got to the beach.... No vapour there.... Signal,\\nthough.... Perhaps he hadn\\'t time.... And I\\'d hate to risk good men on\\nthat hell\\'s cauldron.... Just as much risk here, perhaps. Only it seems--\"\\n\\n\"There it is,\" cried Forsythe. \"Look. The highest point.\"\\n\\nDull, gray wisps of murk, the afterguard of the gaseous cloud, were\\ntwisting and spiraling in a witch-dance across the landscape, and, seen by\\nsnatches and glimpses through it, something flapped darkly in the breeze.\\nSuddenly the veil parted and fled. A flag stood forth in the sharp gust,\\nrigid, and appalling. It was black.\\n\\n\"The Jolly Roger, by God! They\\'ve come back!\" exclaimed Forsythe.\\n\\n\"And set up the sign of their shop,\" added Barnett.\\n\\n\"If they stuck to their flag--good-bye,\" observed Trendon grimly.\\n\\n\"Dr. Trendon,\" said Captain Parkinson, \"you will arm yourself and go with\\nme in the gig to make a landing.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" responded the surgeon.\\n\\n\"Mr. Barnett.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Should we be overtaken by the vapour while on the highland and be unable\\nto get back to the beach, you are to send no rescuing party up there until\\nthe air has cleared.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir, may we not--\"\\n\\n\"Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"In case of an attack you will at once send in another boat with a\\nhowitzer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Trendon, will you see Mr. Slade and inquire of him the best point for\\nlanding?\"\\n\\nTrendon hesitated.\\n\\n\"I suppose it would hardly do to take him with us?\" pursued the commanding\\nofficer.\\n\\n\"If he is roused now, even for a moment, I won\\'t answer for the\\nconsequences, sir,\" said the surgeon bluntly.\\n\\n\"Surely you can have him point out a landing place,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"On your responsibility,\" returned the other, obstinately. \"He\\'s under\\nopiate now.\"\\n\\n\"Be it so,\" said Captain Parkinson, after a time.\\n\\nGoing in, they saw no sign of life along the shore. Even the birds had\\ndeserted it. For the time the volcano seemed to have pretermitted its\\nactivity. Now and again there was a spurtle of smoke from the cone,\\nfollowed by subterranean growlings, but, on the whole, the conditions were\\nreassuring.\\n\\n\"Penny-pop-pinwheel of a volcano, anyhow,\" remarked Trendon,\\ndisparagingly. \"Real man-size eruption would have wiped the whole thing\\noff the map, first whack.\"\\n\\nAs they drew in, it became apparent that they must scale the cliff from\\nthe boat. Farther to the south opened out a wide cove that suggested easy\\nbeaching, but over it hung a cloud of steam.\\n\\n\"Lava pouring down,\" said Trendon.\\n\\nFortunately at the point where the cliff looked easiest the seas ran low.\\nRopes had been brought. After some dainty manoeuvring two of the sailors\\ngained foothold and slung the ropes so that the remainder of the\\ndisembarcation was simple. Nor was the ascent of the cliff a harsh task.\\nHalf an hour after the landing the exploring party stood on the summit of\\nthe hill, where the black flag waved over a scene of utter desolation. The\\nvegetation was withered to pallid rags: even the tiniest weedling in the\\nrock crevices had been poisoned by the devastating blast.\\n\\nIn the midst of that deathly scene, the flag seemed instinct with a\\nsinister liveliness. Whoever had set it there had accurately chosen the\\nhighest available point on that side of the island, the spot of all others\\nwhere it would make good its signal to the eye of any chance farer upon\\nthose shipless seas. For the staff a ten-foot sapling, finely polished,\\nserved. A mound of rock-slabs supported it firmly. Upon the cloth itself\\nwas no design. It was of a dull black, the hue of soot. Captain Parkinson,\\nstanding a few yards off, viewed it with disfavour.\\n\\n\"Furl that flag,\" he ordered.\\n\\nCongdon, the coxswain of the gig, stepped forward and began to work at the\\nfastenings. Presently he turned a grinning face to the captain, who was\\nscanning the landscape through his glass.\\n\\n\"Beggin\\' your pardon, sir,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Well, what is it?\" demanded Captain Parkinson.\\n\\n\"Beggin\\' your pardon, sir, that ain\\'t rightly no flag. That\\'s what you\\nmight rightly call a garment, sir. It\\'s an undershirt, beggin\\' your\\npardon.\"\\n\\n\"Black undershirt\\'s a new one to me,\" muttered Trendon.\\n\\n\"No, sir. It ain\\'t rightly black, look.\"\\n\\nWrenching the object from its fastenings, he flapped it violently. A cloud\\nof sooty dust, beaten out, spread about his face. With a strangled cry the\\nsailor cast the shirt from him and rolled in agony upon the ground.\\n\\n\"You fool!\" cried Trendon. \"Stand back, all of you.\"\\n\\nOpening his medicine case, he bent over the racked sufferer. Presently the\\nman sat up, pale and abashed.\\n\\n\"That\\'s how poisonous volcanic gas is,\" said the surgeon to his commanding\\nofficer. \"Only inhaled remnants of the dust, too.\"\\n\\n\"An ill outlook for the man we\\'re seeking,\" the captain mused.\\n\\n\"Dead if he\\'s anywhere on this highland,\" declared Trendon. \"Let\\'s look at\\nhis flag-pole.\"\\n\\nHe examined the staff. \"Came from the beach,\" he pronounced. \"Waterworn.\\nH\\'m! Maybe he ain\\'t so dead, either.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite follow you, Dr. Trendon.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I guess our man has figured this thing all out. Brought this pole up\\nfrom the beach to plant it here. Why? Because this was the best\\nobservation point. No good as a permanent residence, though. Planted his\\nflag and went back.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t we see him on the beach, then?\"\\n\\n\"Did you notice a cave around to the north? Good refuge in case of fumes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s worth trying,\" said the captain, putting up his glass.\\n\\n\"Hold on, sir. What\\'s this? Here\\'s something. Look here.\"\\n\\nTrendon pointed to a small bit of wood rather neatly carved to the shape\\nof an indicatory finger, and lashed to the staff, at the height of a man\\'s\\nface. The others clustered around.\\n\\n\"Oh, the devil!\" cried Trendon. \"It must have got twisted. It\\'s pointing\\nstraight down.\"\\n\\n\"Strange performance,\" said the captain. \"However, since it points that\\nway--heave aside those rocks, men.\"\\n\\nThe first slab lifted brought to light a corner of cardboard. This, on\\ncloser examination, proved to be the cover of a book. The rocks rolled\\nright and left, and as the flag-staff, deprived of its support, tottered\\nand fell, the trove was dragged forth and handed to the captain. While the\\nground jarred with occasional tremors and the mountain puffed forth its\\nvaporous threats, he and the surgeon, seated on a rock, gave themselves\\nwith complete absorption to the reading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nTHE CACHE\\n\\n\\nOutwardly the book accorded ill with its surroundings. In that place of\\ndesolation and death, it typified the petty neatness of office processes.\\nProperly placed, it should have been found on a desk, with pens, rulers,\\nand other paraphernalia forming exact angles or parallels to it. It was a\\nquarto, bound in marbled paper, with black leather over the hinges. No\\nexternal label suggested its ownership or uses, but through one corner,\\nblackened and formidable in its contrast to the peaceful purposes of the\\nvolume, a hole had been bored. The agency of perforation was obvious. A\\nbullet had made it.\\n\\n\"Seen something of life, I reckon,\" said Trendon, as the captain turned\\nthe volume about slowly in his hands.\\n\\n\"And of death,\" returned Captain Parkinson solemnly. \"Do you know,\\nTrendon, I almost dread to open this.\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw!\" returned the other. \"What is it to us?\"\\n\\nHe threw the cover back. Neatly lettered on the inside, in the fine and\\nslightly angular writing characteristic of the Teutonic scholar, was the\\nlegend:\\n\\n    Karl Augustus Schermerhorn,\\n        1409-1/2 Spruce Street,\\n            Philadelphia, Pa.\\n\\n[Illustration: With a strangled cry the sailor cast the shirt from him]\\n\\nThe opposite page was blank. Captain Parkinson turned half a dozen leaves.\\n\\n\"German!\" he cried, in a note of disappointment, \"Can you read German\\nscript?\"\\n\\n\"After a fashion,\" replied the other. \"Let\\'s see. _Es wonnte sechs--und--\\ndreissig unterjacke_,\" he read. \"Why, blast it, was the man running a\\nhaberdashery? What have three dozen undershirts to do with this?\"\\n\\n\"A memorandum for outfitting, probably,\" suggested the captain. \"Try\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"Chemical formulae,\" said Trendon. \"Pages of \\'em. The devil! Can\\'t make a\\nthing of it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, here\\'s something in English.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" said the other. \"_By combining the hyper-sulphate of iridium with\\nthe fumes arising from oxide of copper heated to 1000 C. and combining\\nwith picric acid in the proportions described in formula x 18, a reaction,\\nthe nature of which I have not fully determined, follows. This must be\\nperformed with extreme care owing to the unstable nature of the benzene\\ncompounds._\"\\n\\n\"Picric acid? Benzene compounds? Those are high explosives,\" said Captain\\nParkinson. \"We should have Barnett go over this.\"\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a name under the formula. _Dr. A. Mardenter, Ann Arbor, Mich_.\\nThat explains its being in English. Probably copied from a letter.\"\\n\\n\"This must have been one of the experiments in the valley that Slade told\\nus of,\" said the captain, thoughtfully. \"Why, see here,\" he cried, with\\nsomething like exultation. \"That\\'s what Dr. Schermerhorn was doing here.\\nHe has the clue to some explosive so terrific that he goes far out of the\\nworld to experiment with its manufacture. For companions he chooses a gang\\nof cutthroats that the world would never miss in case anything went wrong.\\nPossibly it was some trial of the finished product that started the\\neruption, even. Do you see?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t explain enough,\" grunted Trendon. \"Deserted ship. Billy Edwards.\\nMysterious lights. Slade and his story. Any explosives in those? Good\\nenough, far as it goes. Don\\'t go far enough.\"\\n\\n\"It certainly leaves gaps,\" admitted the other.\\n\\nHe turned over a few more pages.\\n\\n\"Formulas, formulas, formulas. What\\'s this? Here are some marginal\\nannotations.\"\\n\\n\"Unbehasslich,\" read Trendon. \"Let\\'s see. That means \\'highly\\nunsatisfactory,\\' or words to that effect. Hi! Here\\'s where the old man\\nloses his temper. Listen: _\\'May the devil take Carroll and Crum for\\ncareless\\'_--h\\'m--well, _\\'pig-dogs.\\'_ Now, where do Carroll and Crum come\\nin?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re a firm of analytical chemists in Washington,\" said the captain.\\n\"When I was on the ordnance board I used to get their circulars.\"\\n\\n\"Fits in. What? More English? Worse than the German, this is.\"\\n\\nThe writing, beginning evenly enough at the top of a page, ran along for a\\nline or two, then fell, sprawling in huge, ragged characters the full\\nlength. Trendon stumbled among them, indignantly.\\n\\n\"_June 1, 1904_,\" he read. \"_It is done. Triumph_. (German word.) _Eureka.\\nEs ist gefillt. From the_ (can\\'t make out that word) _of the\\ninspiration--god-like power--solution of the world-problems_. Why, the\\nold fool is crazy! And his writing is crazier. Can\\'t make head or tail of\\nit.\"\\n\\nThe captain turned several more pages. They were blank. \"At any rate, it\\nseems to be the end,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I should hope so,\" returned the other, disgustedly.\\n\\nHe took the book on his knees, fluttering the leaves between thumb and\\nfinger. Suddenly he checked, cast back, and threw the book wide open.\\n\\n\"Here beginneth a new chapter,\" said he, quietly.\\n\\nNo imaginable chirography could have struck the eye with more of contrast\\nto the professor\\'s small and nervous hand. Large, rounded, and rambling,\\nit filled the page with few and careless words.\\n\\n_June 2, 1904. On this date I find myself sole occupant and absolute\\nmonarch of this valuable island. This morning I was a member of a\\ncommunity, interesting if not precisely peaceful. To-night I am the last\\nleaf. \\'All his lovely companions are faded and gone,\\' the sprightly\\nSolomon, the psychic Nigger, the amiable Thrackles, the cheerful Perdosa,\\nthe genial Pulz, and the high-minded Eagen. Undoubtedly the social\\natmosphere has cleared; moreover, I am for the first time in my life a\\nlanded proprietor. Item: several square miles of grass land; item: several\\ndozen head of sheep; item: a cove full of fish; item: a handsomely\\ndecorated cave; item: a sportive though somewhat unruly volcano. At times,\\nit may be, I shall feel the lack of company. The seagulls alone are not\\ndistrustful of me. Undoubtedly the seagull is an estimable creature, but\\nhe leaves something to be desired in the way of companionship. Hence this\\ndiary, the inevitable refuge of the empty-minded. Materially, I shall do\\nwell enough, though I face one tragic circumstance. My cigarette material,\\nI find, is short. Upon counting up--\"_\\n\\n\"Damn his cigarettes!\" cried the surgeon. \"This must be Darrow. Finicky\\nbeast! Let\\'s see if it\\'s signed.\"\\n\\nHe whirled the leaves over to the last sheet, glanced at it, and sprang to\\nhis feet. There, sprawled in tremulous characters, as by a hand shaken\\nwith agony or terror, was written:\\n\\n    _Look for me in the cave.\\n                         Percy Darrow._\\n\\nThe bullet hole in the corner furnished a sinister period to the\\nsignature.\\n\\nTrendon handed the ledger back to the captain, who took one quick look,\\nclosed it, and handed it to Congdon.\\n\\n\"Wrap that up and carry it carefully,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the coxswain, swathing it in his jacket and tucking\\nit under his arm.\\n\\n\"Now to find that cave,\" said Captain Parkinson to the surgeon.\\n\\n\"The cave in the cliff, of course,\" said Trendon. \"Noticed it coming in,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\n\"Where?\"\\n\\n\"On the north shore, about a mile to the east of here.\"\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll cut directly across.\"\\n\\n\"Beg your pardon, sir,\" put in Congdon, \"but I don\\'t think we can make it\\nfrom this side, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"No beach, sir, and the cliff\\'s like the side of a ship. Looks to be deep\\nwater right into the cave\\'s mouth.\"\\n\\n\"Back to the boat, then. Bring that flag along.\"\\n\\nThe descent was swift, at times reckless, but the party embarked without\\naccident. Soon they were forging through the water at racing speed, the\\nboat leaping to the impulsion of the sailorman\\'s strongest motives,\\ncuriosity and the hope of saving a life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nTHE TWIN SLABS\\n\\n\\nWithin half an hour the gig had reached the mouth of the cave. As the\\ncoxswain had predicted, the seas ran into the lofty entrance. Elsewhere\\nthe surf fell whitely, but through the arch the waves rolled unbroken into\\na heavy stillness. Only as the boat hovered for a moment at the face of\\nthe cliff could the exploring party hear, far within, the hollow boom that\\ntold of breakers on a distant, subterranean beach.\\n\\n\"Run her in easy,\" came the captain\\'s order. \"Keep a sharp lookout for\\nhidden rocks.\"\\n\\nTo the whispering plash of the oars they moved from sunlight into\\ntwilight, from twilight into darkness. Of a sudden the oars jerked\\nconvulsively. A great roar had broken upon the ears of the sailors; the\\ninvisible roof above them, the water heaving beneath them, the walls that\\nhemmed them in, called, with a multiplication of resonance, upon the name\\nof Darrow. The boat quivered with the start of its occupants. Then one or\\ntwo laughed weakly as they realised that what they had heard was no\\nsupernatural voice. It was the captain hailing for the marooned man.\\n\\nNo vocal answer came. But an indeterminable space away they could hear a\\nlow splash followed by a second and a third. Something coughed weakly in\\nfront and to the right. Trendon\\'s hand went to his revolver. The men sat,\\nstiffened. One of them swore, in a whisper, and the oath came back upon\\nthem, echoing the name of the Saviour in hideous sibilance.\\n\\n\"Silence in the boat,\" said the captain, in such buoyant tones that the\\nmen braced themselves against the expected peril.\\n\\n\"Light the lantern and pass it to me,\" came the order. \"Keep below the\\ngunwale, men.\"\\n\\nAs the match spluttered: \"Do you see something, a few rods to port?\" asked\\nthe captain in Trendon\\'s ear.\\n\\n\"Pair of green lights,\" said Trendon. \"Eyes. _Seals!_\"\\n\\n\"_Seals! Seals! Seals_!\" shouted the walls, for the surgeon had suddenly\\nreleased his voice. And as the mockery boomed, the green lights\\ndisappeared and there was more splashing from the distance. The crew sat\\nup again.\\n\\nThe lantern spread its radiance. It was reflected from battlements of\\nfairy beauty. Everywhere the walls were set, as with gems, in broad wales\\nof varied and vivid hues. Dazzled at first, the explorers soon were able\\nto discern the general nature of the subterranean world which they had\\nentered. In most places the walls rose sheer and unscaleable from the\\nwater. In others, turretted rocks thrust their gleaming crags upward. Over\\nto starboard a little beach shone with Quaker greyness in that spectacular\\ndisplay. The end of the cavern was still beyond the area of light.\\n\\n\"Must have been a swimmer to get in here,\" commented Trendon, glancing at\\nthe walls.\\n\\n\"Unless he had a boat,\" said the captain. \"But why doesn\\'t he answer?\"\\n\\n\"Better try again. No telling how much more there is of this.\"\\n\\nThe surgeon raised his ponderous bellow, and the cave roared again with\\nthe summons. Silence, formidable and unbroken, succeeded.\\n\\n\"House to house search is now in order,\" he said. \"Must be in here\\nsomewhere--unless the seals got him.\"\\n\\nCautiously the boat moved forward. Once she grazed on a half submerged\\nrock. Again a tiny islet loomed before her. Scattered bones glistened on\\nthe rocky shore, but they were not human relics. Occasional beaches\\ntempted a landing, but all of these led back to precipitous cliffs except\\none, from the side of which opened two small caves. Into the first the\\nlantern cast its glare, revealing emptiness, for the arch was wide and the\\ncave shallow. The entrance to the other was so narrow as to send a visitor\\nto his knees. But inside it seemed to open out. Moreover, there were fish\\nbones at the entrance. The captain, the surgeon, and Congdon, the\\ncoxswain, landed. Captain Parkinson reached the spot first. Stooping, he\\nthrust his head in at the orifice. A sharp exclamation broke from him. He\\nrose to his feet, turning a contorted face to the others.\\n\\n\"Poisonous,\" he cried.\\n\\n\"More volcano,\" said Trendon. He bent to the black hole and sniffed\\ncautiously.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go in, sir,\" volunteered Congdon. \"I\\'ve had fire-practice.\"\\n\\n\"My business,\" said Trendon, briefly. \"Decomposition; unpleasant, but not\\ndangerous.\"\\n\\nPushing the lantern before him, he wormed his way until the light was\\nblotted out. Presently it shone forth from the funnel, showing that the\\nexplorer had reached the inner open space. Captain Parkinson dropped down\\nand peered in, but the evil odour was too much for him. He retired,\\ngagging and coughing. Trendon was gone for what seemed an interminable\\ntime. His superior officer fidgeted uneasily. At last he could stand it no\\nlonger.\\n\\n\"Dr. Trendon, are you all right?\" he shouted.\\n\\n\"Yup,\" answered a choked voice. \"Cubbing oud dow.\"\\n\\nAgain the funnel was darkened. A pair of feet appeared; then the surgeon\\'s\\nchunky trunk, his head, and the lantern. Once, twice, and thrice he\\ninhaled deeply.\\n\\n\"Phew!\" he gasped. \"Thought I was tough, but--Phee-ee-ee-ew!\"\\n\\n\"Did you find--\"\\n\\n\"No, sir. Not Darrow. Only a poor devil of a seal that crawled in there to\\ndie.\"\\n\\nThe exploration continued. Half a mile, as they estimated, from the open,\\nthey reached a narrow beach, shut off by a perpendicular wall of rock.\\nSkirting this, they returned on the other side, minutely examining every\\npossible crevice. When they again reached the light of day, they had\\narrived at the certain conclusion that no living man was within those\\nwalls.\\n\\n\"Would a corpse rise to the surface soon in waters such as these, Dr.\\nTrendon?\" asked the captain.\\n\\n\"Might, sir. Might not. No telling that.\"\\n\\nThe captain ruminated. Then he beat his fist on his knee.\\n\\n\"The other cave!\"\\n\\n\"What other cave?\" asked the surgeon.\\n\\n\"The cave where they killed the seals.\"\\n\\n\"Surely!\" exclaimed Trendon. \"Wait, though. Didn\\'t Slade say it was\\nbetween here and the point?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Beyond the small beach.\"\\n\\n\"No cave there,\" declared the surgeon positively.\\n\\n\"There must be. Congdon, did you see an opening anywhere in the cliff as\\nwe came along?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir. This is the only one, sir.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see about that,\" said the captain, grimly. \"Head her about. Skirt\\nthe shore as near the breakers as you safely can.\"\\n\\nThe gig retraced its journey.\\n\\n\"There\\'s the beach, as Slade described it,\" said Captain Parkinson, as\\nthey came abreast of the little reach of sand.\\n\\n\"And what are those two bird-roosts on it?\" asked Trendon. \"See \\'em? Dead\\nagainst that patch of shore-weed.\"\\n\\n\"Bits of wreckage fixed in the sand.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t think so, sir. Too well matched.\"\\n\\n\"We have no time to settle the matter now,\" said the captain impatiently.\\n\"We must find that cave, if it is to be found.\"\\n\\nHovering just outside the final drag of the surf, under the skilful\\nguidance of Congdon, the boat moved slowly along the line of beach to the\\nline of cliff. All was open as the day. The blazing sun picked out each\\ndetail of jut and hollow. Evidently the poisonous vapours from the volcano\\nhad not spread their blight here, for the face of the precipice was bright\\nwith many flowers. So close in moved the boat that its occupants could\\neven see butterflies fluttering above the bloom. But that which their\\neager eyes sought was still denied them. No opening offered in that\\nsmiling cliff-side. Not by so much as would admit a terrier did the mass\\nof rock and rubble gape.\\n\\n\"And Slade described the cave as big enough to ram the _Wolverine_ into,\"\\nmuttered Trendon.\\n\\nUp to the point of the headland, and back, passed the boat. Blank\\ndisappointment was the result.\\n\\n\"What is your opinion now, Dr. Trendon?\" asked the captain of the older\\nman.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know, sir,\" answered the surgeon hopelessly. \"Looks as if the cave\\nmight have been a hallucination.\"\\n\\n\"I shall have something to say to Mr. Slade on our return,\" said the\\ncaptain crisply. \"If the cave was an hallucination, as you suggest, the\\nseal-murder was fiction.\"\\n\\n\"Looks so,\" agreed the other.\\n\\n\"And the murder of the captain. How about that?\"\\n\\n\"And the mutiny of the men,\" added the surgeon.\\n\\n\"And the killing of the doctor. Your patient seems to be a romantic\\ngenius.\"\\n\\n\"And the escape of Darrow. Hold hard,\" quoth Trendon. \"Darrow\\'s no\\nromance. Nothing fictional about the flag and ledger.\"\\n\\n\"True enough,\" said the captain, and fell to consideration.\\n\\n\"Anyway,\" said Trendon vigorously, \"I\\'d like to have a look at those bird-\\nroosts. Mighty like signposts, to my mind.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the captain. \"It\\'ll cost us only a wetting. Run her in,\\nCongdon.\"\\n\\nWith all the coxswain\\'s skill, and the oarsmen\\'s technique, the passage of\\nthe surf was a lively one, and little driblets of water marked the trail\\nof the officers as they shuffled up the beach.\\n\\nThe two slabs stood less than fifty yards beyond high water tide. Nearing\\nthem, the visitors saw that each marked a mound, but not until they were\\nclose up could they read the neat carving on the first. It ran as follows:\\n\\n            _Here lies_\\n           SOLOMON ANDERSON\\n              _alias_\\n            HANDY SOLOMON\\n    _who murdered his employer,\\n    his captain, and his shipmates,\\n    and was found, dead\\n    of his deserts, on these shores,\\n    June 5, 1904.\\n\\n    This slab is erected as a\\n    memento of admiring esteem\\n               by\\n    the last of his victims.\\n\\n    \"And you can kiss the\\n    Book on that.\"_\\n\\n\"Percy Darrow _fecit_,\" said the surgeon. \"You can kiss the Book on\\n_that_, too.\"\\n\\n\"Then Slade was telling the truth!\"\\n\\n\"Apparently. Seems good corroboration.\"\\n\\nThe captain turned to the other mound. Its slab was carved by the same\\nhand.\\n\\n  _Sacred to the memory of an\\n  Ensign of the U. S. Navy,\\n  whose body, washed upon this\\n  coast, is here buried with all\\n  reverence, by strange hands;\\n  whose soul may God rest.\\n  \"The seas shall sing his\\n  requiem.\" June the Sixth,\\n  MXMIV._\\n\\n\"Billy Edwards,\" said the captain, very low.\\n\\nHe uncovered. The surgeon did likewise. So, for a space, they stood with\\nbared heads between the twin graves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nTHE PINWHEEL VOLCANO\\n\\n\\nThe surgeon spoke first.\\n\\n\"Another point,\" said he. \"Darrow was alive within a few days.\"\\n\\nCaptain Parkinson turned slowly away from the grave. \"You are right,\" he\\nsaid, with an effort. \"Our business is with the living now. The dead must\\nwait.\"\\n\\n\"Hide and seek,\" growled Trendon. \"If he\\'s here why don\\'t he show\\nhimself?\"\\n\\nThe other shook his head.\\n\\n\"Place is all trampled up with his footprints,\" said Trendon. \"He\\'s\\nplodded back and forth like a prisoner in a cell.\"\\n\\n\"The ledger,\" said the captain. \"I\\'d forgotten it. That grave drove\\neverything else out of my mind.\"\\n\\n\"Bring the book here,\" called Trendon.\\n\\nCongdon unwrapped it from his jacket and handed it to him. The sailors\\ncast curious glances at the two headstones.\\n\\n\"Mount guard over Mr. Edwards\\'s grave,\" commanded the captain.\\n\\nThe coxswain saluted and gave an order. One of the sailors stepped forward\\nto the first mound.\\n\\n\"Not that one,\" rasped the officer. \"The other.\"\\n\\nThe man saluted and moved on.\\n\\n\"With your permission, sir,\" said Trendon.\\n\\nOn a nod from his superior officer he opened the ledger and took up\\nDarrow\\'s record.\\n\\n\"Here it is. Entry of June 3d.\"\\n\\n\"_Everything lovely. Schooner lost to sight. Query--to memory dear? Not\\nexactly. Though I shouldn\\'t mind having her under orders for a few days.\\nQueer glow in the sky last night: if they\\'ve been investigating they may\\nhave got what\\'s coming to them. Volcano exhibiting fits of temper. Spouted\\nout considerable fire about nine o\\'clock. Quite spectacular, but no harm\\ndone. Can foresee short rations of tobacco. Lava in valley still too hot\\nfor comfort. No sign of Dr. Schermerhorn. Still sleep on beach_.\\n\\n\"Not much there,\" sniffed Trendon. \"Go on,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"_June 3. Evening. Thick and squally weather again. Local atmospheric\\nconditions seem upset. Volcano still leading strenuous life. Climbed the\\nheadland this afternoon. Wind very shifty. Got an occasional whiff of\\nvolcanic output. One in particular would have sent a skunk to the camphor\\nbottle. No living on the headland. Will explore cave to-morrow with a view\\nto domicile. Have come down to an allowance of seven cigarettes per diem.\\n\\n\"June 4. Explored cave to-day. Full of dead seals. Not only dead, but all\\nbitten and cut to pieces. Must have been lively doings in Seal-Town. Not\\nmuch choice between air in the cave and vapours from the volcano. Barring\\nseals, everything suitable for light housekeeping, such as mine. Undertook\\nto clean house. Dragged late lamented out into the water. Some sank and\\nwere swept away by the sea-puss. Others, I regret to say, floated. Found\\ntrickle of fresh water in depth of cave, and little sand-ledge to sleep\\non. So far, so good: we may be \\'appy yet. If only I had my cigarette\\nsupply. Once heard a botanist say that leaves of the white shore-willow\\nmade fair substitute for tobacco. Fair substitute for nux vomica! Would\\nlike to interview said botanist_.\\n\\n\"The fellow is a tobacco maniac,\" growled Trendon, feeling in his breast\\npocket. \"The devil,\" he cried, bringing forth an empty hand.\\n\\nSilently the captain handed him a cigar. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said,\\nlighted it, and continued reading.\\n\\n\"_June 5. Had a caller to-day. Climbed the headland this morning. Found\\nvolcano taking a day off. Looking for sign of _Laughing Lass_, noticed\\nsomething heliographing to me from the waves beyond the reef. Seemed to be\\nmetal. I guessed a tin can. Caught in the swirl, it rounded the cape, and\\nI came down to the shore to meet it. Halfway down the cliff I had a better\\nview. I saw it was not a tin can. There was a dark body under it, which\\nthe waves were tossing about, and as the metal moved with the body, it\\nglinted in the sun. Suddenly it was borne in upon me that an arm was doing\\nthe signalling, waving to me with a sprightly, even a jocular\\nfriendliness. Then I saw what it really was. It was Handy Solomon and his\\nsteel hook. He was riding quite high. Every now and again he would bow and\\nwave. He grounded gently on the sand beach. I planted him promptly. First,\\nhowever, I removed a bag of tobacco from his pocket. Poor stuff, and water\\nsoaked, but still tobacco. Spent a quiet afternoon carving a headstone for\\nthe dear departed. Pity it were that virtues so shining should be\\nuncommemorated. Idle as the speculation is, I wonder who my next visitor\\nwill be. Thrackles, I hope. Evidently some of them have been playing the\\npart of Pandora. Spent last night in the cave. Air quite fresh.\\n\\n\"June 6. Saw the glow again last night.\"_\\n\\nThe surgeon paused in his reading. \"That would be the night of the 5th:\\nthe night before we picked her up empty.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" agreed Captain Parkinson. \"That was the night Billy Edwards--Go\\non.\"\\n\\n\"_Saw the glow again last night. Don\\'t understand it. Once should have\\nbeen enough for them. This matter of hoarding tobacco may be a sad error.\\nIf Old Spitfire keeps on the way she has to-day I shan\\'t need much more.\\nIt would be a raw jest to be burned or swallowed up with a month\\'s supply\\nof unsmoked cigarettes on one. Cave getting shaky. Still, I think I\\'ll\\nstick there. As between being burned alive and buried alive, I\\'m for the\\nrespectable and time honoured fashion of interment. Bombardment was mostly\\nto the east to-day, but no telling when it may shift.\\n\\n\"June 7. This morning I found a body rolling in the surf. It was the body\\nof a young man, large and strongly built, dressed in the uniform of an\\nensign of our navy. Surely a strange visitor to these shores! There was no\\nmark of identification upon him except a cigarette case graven with an\\nundecipherable monogram in Tiffany\\'s most illegible style of arrow-headed\\ninscription. This I buried with him, and staked the grave with a\\nheadboard. An officer and a gentleman, a youth of friendly ways and kindly\\nliving, if one may judge by the face of the dead; and he comes by the same\\nend to the same goal as Handy Solomon. Why not? And why should one\\nphilosophise in a book that will never be read? Hold on! Perhaps--just\\nperhaps--it may be read. The officer was not long dead. Ensigns of the U.\\nS. navy do not wander about untraversed waters alone. There must be a\\nwarship somewhere in the vicinity. But why, then, an unburied officer\\nfloating on the ocean? I will smoke upon this, luxuriously and\\nplentifully. (Later.) No use. I can\\'t solve it. But one thing I do. I put\\nup a signal pole on the headland and cache this record under it this\\nafternoon. From day to day, with the kindly permission of the volcano, I\\nwill add to it.... Bad doings by Old Spitfire. The cloud is coming down on\\nme. Also seems to be moving along the cliff. I will retire hastily to my\\nprivate estate in the cave_.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all, except the scrawl on the last page,\" said Trendon. \"Some\\naction of the volcano scared him off. He just had time to scrawl that last\\nmessage and drop the book into the cache. The question is, did he get back\\nalive?\"\\n\\n\"I doubt it,\" said the captain. \"We will search the headland for his\\nbody.\"\\n\\n\"But the cave,\" insisted the surgeon. \"We ought to have found some sign of\\nhim there.\"\\n\\n\"Slade is the solution,\" said the captain. \"We must ask him.\"\\n\\nThey put back to the ship. Barnett was anxiously awaiting them.\\n\\n\"Your patient has been in a bad way, Dr. Trendon,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" asked Trendon, frowning.\\n\\n\"He came up on deck, wild-eyed and staggering. There was a sheet of paper\\nin his hand which seemed to have some bearing on his trouble. When he\\nfound you had gone to the island without him he began to rage like a\\nmaniac. I had to have him carried down by force. In the rumpus the paper\\ndisappeared. I assumed the responsibility of giving him an opiate.\"\\n\\n\"Quite right,\" approved Trendon. \"I\\'ll go down. Will you come with me,\\nsir?\" he said to the captain.\\n\\nThey found Slade in profound slumber.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t do to wake him now,\" growled Trendon. \"Hello, what\\'s here?\"\\n\\nLying in the hollow of the sick man\\'s right hand, where it had been\\ncrushed to a ball, was a crumpled mass of tracing paper. Trendon smoothed\\nit out, peered at it and passed it to the captain.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a sketch of an Indian arrow-head,\" he exclaimed in surprise, at the\\nfirst glance. \"What are all these marks?\"\\n\\n\"Map of the island,\" barked Trendon. \"Look here.\"\\n\\nThe drawing was a fairly careful one, showing such geographical points as\\nhad been of concern to the two-year inhabitants. There was the large\\ncavern, indicated as they had found it, and at a point between it and the\\nheadland the legend, \"Seal Cave.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s wrong,\" cried Captain Parkinson, setting finger to the spot. \"We\\npassed there twice. There\\'s no opening.\"\\n\\n\"No guarantee that there may not have been,\" returned the other. \"This\\nisland has been considerably shaken up lately. Entrance may have been\\nclosed by a landslide down the cliff. Noticed signs myself, but didn\\'t\\nthink of it in connection with the cave.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s work for Barnett, then,\" said the captain, brightening. \"We\\'ll\\nblow up the whole face of the cliff, if necessary, but we\\'ll get at that\\ncave.\"\\n\\nHe hurried out. Order followed order, and soon the gig, with the captain,\\nTrendon, and the torpedo expert, was driving for the point marked \"Seal\\nCave\" on the map over which they were bent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nMR. DARROW RECEIVES\\n\\n\\n\"You say the last entry is June 7th?\" asked Barnett, as the boat entered\\nthe light surf.\\n\\nTrendon nodded.\\n\\n\"That was the night we saw the last glow, and the big burst from the\\nvolcano, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Right.\"\\n\\n\"The island would have been badly shaken up.\"\\n\\n\"Not so violently but that the flag-pole stood,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, sir. But there\\'s been a good deal of volcanic gas going. The\\nman\\'s been penned up for four days.\"\\n\\n\"Give the fellow a chance,\" growled Trendon. \"Air may be all right in the\\ncave. Good water there, too. Says so himself. By Slade\\'s account he\\'s a\\npretty capable citizen when it comes to looking after himself. Wouldn\\'t\\nwonder if we\\'d find him fit as a fiddle.\"\\n\\n\"There was no clue to Ives and McGuire?\" asked Barnett presently.\\n\\n\"None.\" It was the captain who answered.\\n\\nThe gig grated, and the tide being high, they waded to the base of the\\ncliff, Barnett carrying his precious explosives aloft in his arms.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the spot,\" said the captain. \"See where the water goes in through\\nthose crevices.\"\\n\\n\"Opening at the top, too,\" said Trendon.\\n\\nHe let out his bellow, roaring Darrow\\'s name.\\n\\n\"I doubt if you could project your voice far into a cave thus blocked,\"\\nsaid Captain Parkinson. \"We\\'ll try this.\"\\n\\nHe drew his revolver and fired. The men listened at the crevices of the\\nrock. No sound came from within.\\n\\n\"Your enterprise, Mr. Barnett,\" said the commander, with a gesture which\\nturned over the conduct of the affair to the torpedo expert.\\n\\nBarnett examined the rocks with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Looks like moderately easy stuff,\" he observed. \"See how the veins run.\\nYou could almost blow a design to order in that.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but how about bringing down the whole cave?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course there\\'s always an element of uncertainty when you\\'re\\ndealing with high explosives,\" admitted the expert. \"But unless I\\'m\\nmistaken, we can chop this out as neat as with an axe.\"\\n\\nDropping his load of cartridges carelessly upon a flat rock which\\nprojected from the water, he busied himself in a search along the face of\\nthe cliff. Presently, with an \"Ah,\" of satisfaction, he climbed toward a\\nhand\\'s breadth of platform where grew a patch of purple flowers.\\n\\n\"Throw me up a knife, somebody,\" he called.\\n\\n\"Take notice,\" said Trendon, good-naturedly, \"that I\\'m the botanist of\\nthis expedition.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you can have the flowers. All I want is what they grow in.\"\\n\\nLoosening a handful of the dry soil, he brought it down and laid it with\\nthe explosives. Next he called one of the sailors to \"boost\" him, and was\\nsoon perched on the flat slant of a huge rock which formed, as it were,\\nthe keystone to the blockade.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s see,\" he ruminated. \"We want a slow charge for this. One that will\\nexert a widespread pressure without much shattering force. The No. 3, I\\nthink.\"\\n\\n\"How is that, Mr. Barnett?\" asked the captain, with lively interest.\\n\\n\"You see, sir,\" returned the demonstrator, perched high, like a sculptor\\nat work on some heroic masterpiece, \"what we want is to split off this\\nrock.\" He patted the flank of the huge slab. \"There\\'s a lovely vein\\nrunning at an angle inward from where I sit. Split that through, and the\\nrock should roll, of its own weight, away from the entrance. It\\'s held\\nonly by the upper projection that runs under the arch here.\"\\n\\n\"Neat programme,\" commented Trendon, with a tinge of sardonic scepticism.\\n\\n\"Wait and see,\" retorted Barnett blithely, for he was in his element now.\\n\"I\\'ll appoint you my assistant. Just toss me up that cartridge: the third\\none on the left.\"\\n\\nThe surgeon recoiled.\\n\\n\"Supposing you don\\'t catch it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, supposing I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s dynamite, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Something of the same nature. Joveite, it\\'s called.\"\\n\\nStill the surgeon stared at him. Barnett laughed.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'ve got the high explosives superstition,\" he said lightly.\\n\"Dynamite don\\'t go off as easy as people think. You could drop that stuff\\nfrom the cliffhead without danger. Have I got to come down for it?\"\\n\\nWith a wry face Trendon tossed up the package. It was deftly caught.\\n\\n\"Now wet that dirt well. Put it in the canvas bag yonder, and send one of\\nthe men up with it. I\\'m going to make a mud pie.\"\\n\\nBreaking the package open, he spread the yellow powder in a slightly\\ncurving line along the rock. With the mud he capped this over, forming a\\nlittle arched roof.\\n\\n\"To keep it from blowing away,\" surmised Trendon.\\n\\n\"No; to make it blow down instead of blowing up.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, rot!\" returned the downright surgeon. \"That pound of dirt won\\'t make\\nthe shadow of a feather\\'s difference.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t it!\" retorted the other. \"Curious thing about high explosives. A\\nmud-cap will hold down the force as well as a ton of rock. Wait and see\\nwhat happens to the rock beneath.\"\\n\\nHe slid off his perch into the ankle-deep water and waded out to the boat.\\nHere he burrowed for a moment, presently emerging with a box. This he\\ncarried gingerly to a convenient rock and opened. First he lifted out some\\nsoft padding. A small tin box honey-combed inside came to light. With\\ninfinite precaution Barnett picked out an object that looked like a 22-\\ncalibre short cartridge, wadded some cotton batten in his hand, set the\\nthing in the wadding, laid it on the rock, carefully returned the small\\nbox to the large box and the large box to the boat, took up the cartridge\\nagain and waded back to the cliff. They watched him in silence.\\n\\n\"This is the little devil,\" he said, indicating his delicate burden.\\n\"Fulminate of mercury. This is the stuff that\\'ll remove your hand with\\nneatness and despatch. It\\'s the quickest tempered little article in the\\nbusiness. Just give it one hard look and it\\'s off.\"\\n\\n\"Here,\" said Trendon, \"I resign. From now on I\\'m a spectator.\"\\n\\nBarnett swung the fulminate in his handkerchief and gave it to a sailor to\\nhold. The man dandled it like a new-born infant. Back to his rock went\\nBarnett. Producing some cord, he let down an end.\\n\\n\"Tie the handkerchief on, and get out of the way,\" he directed.\\n\\nWith painful slowness the man carried out the first part of the order; the\\nlatter half he obeyed with sprightly alacrity. Very slowly, very\\ndelicately, the expert drew in his dangerous burden. Once a current of air\\npuffed it against the face of the rock, and the operator\\'s head was\\nhastily withdrawn. Nothing happened. Another minute and he had the tiny\\nshell in hand. A fuse was fixed in it and it was shoved under the mud-cap.\\nBarnett stood up.\\n\\n\"Will you kindly order the boat ready, Captain Parkinson?\" he called.\\n\\nThe order was given.\\n\\n\"As soon as I light the fuse I will come down and we\\'ll pull out fifty\\nyards. Leave the rest of the Joveite where it is. All ready? Here goes.\"\\n\\nHe touched a match to the fuse. It caught. For a moment he watched it.\\n\\n\"Going all right,\" he reported, as he struck the water. \"Plenty of time.\"\\n\\nSome seventy yards out they rested on their oars. They waited. And waited.\\nAnd waited.\\n\\n\"It\\'s out,\" grunted Trendon.\\n\\nFrom the face of the cliff puffed a cloud of dust. A thudding report\\nboomed over the water. Just a wisp of whitish-grey smoke arose, and\\nbeneath it the great rock, with a gapping seam across its top, rolled\\nmajestically outward, sending a shower of spray on all sides, and opening\\nto their eager view a black chasm into the heart of the headland. The\\nexperiment had worked out with the accuracy of a geometric problem.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all, sir,\" Barnett reported officially.\\n\\n\"Magic! Modern magic!\" said the captain. He stared at the open door. For\\nthe moment the object of the undertaking was forgotten in the wonder of\\nits exact accomplishment.\\n\\n\"Darrow\\'ll think an earthquake\\'s come after him,\" remarked Trendon.\\n\\n\"Give way,\" ordered the captain.\\n\\nThe boat grated on the sand. Captain Parkinson would have entered, but\\nBarnett restrained him.\\n\\n\"It\\'s best to wait a minute or two,\" he advised. \"Occasionally slides\\nfollow an explosion tardily, and the gases don\\'t always dissipate\\nquickly.\"\\n\\nWhere they stood they could see but a short way into the cave. Trendon\\nsquatted and funnelled his hands to one eye.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"Sorry not to have met you at the door,\" he said\\ncourteously.]\\n\\n\"There\\'s fire inside,\" he said.\\n\\nIn a moment they all saw it, a single, pin-point glow, far back in the\\nblackness, a Cyclopean eye, that swayed as it approached. Alternately it\\nwaned and brightened. Suddenly it illuminated the dim lineaments of a\\nface. The face neared them. It joined itself to reality by a very solid\\npair of shoulders, and a man sauntered into the twilit mouth of the\\ncavern, removed a cigarette from his lips, and gave them greeting.\\n\\n\"Sorry not to have met you at the door,\" he said, courteously. \"It was you\\nthat knocked, was it not? Yes? It roused me from my siesta.\"\\n\\nThey stared at him in silence. He blinked in the light, with unaccustomed\\neyes.\\n\\n\"You will pardon me for not asking you in at once. Past circumstances have\\nrendered me--well--perhaps suspicious is not too strong a word.\"\\n\\nThey noticed that he held a revolver in his hand.\\n\\nCaptain Parkinson came forward a step. The host half raised his weapon.\\nThen he dropped it abruptly.\\n\\n\"Navy men!\" he said, in an altered voice. \"I beg your pardon. I could not\\nsee at first. My name is Percy Darrow.\"\\n\\n\"I am Captain Parkinson of the United States cruiser _Wolverine_,\" said\\nthe commander. \"This is Mr. Barnett, Mr. Darrow. Dr. Trendon, Mr. Darrow.\"\\n\\nThey shook hands all around.\\n\\n\"Like some damned silly afternoon tea,\" Trendon said later, in retailing\\nit to the mess. A pause followed.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you step in, gentlemen?\" said Darrow, \"May I offer you the makings\\nof a cigarette?\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you be robbing yourself?\" inquired the captain, with a twinkle.\\n\\n\"Oh, you found the diary, then,\" said Darrow easily. \"Rather silly of me\\nto complain so. But really, in conditions like these, tobacco becomes a\\nserious problem.\"\\n\\n\"So one might imagine,\" said Trendon drily. He looked closely at Darrow.\\nThe man\\'s eyes were light and dancing. From the nostrils two livid lines\\nran diagonally. Such lines one might make with a hard blue pencil pressed\\nstrongly into the flesh. The surgeon moved a little nearer.\\n\\n\"Can you give me any news of my friend Thrackles?\" asked Darrow lightly.\\n\"Or the esteemed Pulz? Or the scholarly and urbane Robinson of Ethiopian\\nextraction?\"\\n\\n\"Dead,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"Ah, a pity,\" said the other. He put his hand to his forehead. \"I had\\nthought it probable.\" His face twitched. \"Dead? Very good. In fact ...\\nreally ... er ... amusing.\"\\n\\nHe began to laugh, quite to himself. It was not a pleasant laugh to hear.\\nTrendon caught and shook him by the shoulder.\\n\\n\"Drop it,\" he said.\\n\\nDarrow seemed not to hear him. \"Dead, all dead!\" he repeated. \"And I\\'ve\\noutlasted \\'em! God damn \\'em, I\\'ve outlasted \\'em!\" And his mirth broke\\nforth in a strangely shocking spasm.\\n\\nTrendon lifted a hand and struck him so powerfully between the shoulder\\nblades that he all but plunged forward on his face.\\n\\n\"Quit it!\" he ordered again. \"Get hold of yourself!\"\\n\\nDarrow turned and gripped him. The surgeon winced with the pain of his\\ngrasp. \"I can\\'t,\" gasped the maroon, between paroxysms. \"I\\'ve been living\\nin hell. A black, shaking, shivering hell, for God knows how long.... What\\ndo you know? Have you ever been buried alive?\" And again the agony of\\nlaughter shook him.\\n\\n\"This, then,\" muttered the doctor, and the hypodermic needle shot home.\\n\\nDuring the return Darrow lay like a log in the bottom of the gig. The\\nopiate had done its work. Consciousness was mercifully dead within him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nTHE SURVIVORS\\n\\n\\nRest and good food quickly brought Percy Darrow back to his normal poise.\\nOne inspection satisfied Dr. Trendon that all was well with him. He asked\\nto see the captain, and that gentleman came to Ives\\'s room, which had been\\nassigned to the rescued man.\\n\\n\"I hope you\\'ve been able to make yourself comfortable,\" said the\\ncommander, courteously.\\n\\n\"It would be strange indeed if I could not,\" returned Darrow, smiling.\\n\"You forget that you have set a savage down in the midst of luxury.\"\\n\\n\"Make yourself free of Ives\\'s things,\" invited Captain Parkinson. \"Poor\\nfellow; he will not use them again, I fear.\"\\n\\n\"One of your men lost?\" asked Darrow. \"Ah, the young officer whose body I\\nfound on the beach, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"No; but we have to thank you for that burial,\" said the captain.\\n\\nDarrow made a swift gesture. \"Oh, if thanks are going,\" he cried, and\\npaused in hopelessness of adequate expression.\\n\\n\"This has been a bitter cruise for us,\" continued the captain. He sighed\\nand was silent for a moment. \"There is much to tell and to be told,\" he\\nresumed.\\n\\n\"Much,\" agreed the other, gravely.\\n\\n\"You will want to see Slade first, I presume,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"One of your officers whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting?\"\\n\\nThe captain stared. \"Slade,\" he said. \"Ralph Slade.\"\\n\\n\"Apparently there\\'s a missing link. Or--I fear I was not wholly myself\\nyesterday for a time. Possibly something occurred that I did not quite\\ntake in.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we\\'d better wait,\" said Captain Parkinson, with obvious\\nmisgiving. \"You\\'re not quite rested. You will feel more like--\"\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t mind,\" said Darrow composedly, \"I\\'d like to get at this\\nthing now. I\\'m in excellent understanding, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. I am speaking of the man who acted as mate in the _Laughing\\nLass_. The journalist who--good heavens! What arrant stupidity! I have to\\nbeg your pardon, Mr. Darrow. It has just occurred to me. He called himself\\nEagen with you.\"\\n\\n\"Eagen! What is this? Is Eagen alive?\"\\n\\n\"And on this ship. We picked him up in an open boat.\"\\n\\n\"And you say he calls himself Slade?\"\\n\\n\"He is Ralph Slade, adventurer and journalist. Mr. Barnett knows him and\\nvouches for him.\"\\n\\n\"And he was on our island under an assumed name,\" said Darrow in tones\\nthat had the smoothness and the rasp of silk. \"Rather annoying. Not good\\nform, quite, even for a pirate.\"\\n\\n\"Yet, I believe he saved your life,\" suggested the captain.\\n\\nDarrow looked up sharply. \"Why, yes,\" he admitted. \"So he did. I had\\nhoped--\" He checked himself. \"I had thought that all of the crew went the\\nsame way. You didn\\'t find any of the others?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\nDarrow got to his feet. \"I think I\\'d like to see Eagen--Slade--whatever he\\ncalls himself.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" began the captain. \"It might not be--\" He hesitated and\\nstopped.\\n\\nDarrow drew back a little, misinterpreting the other\\'s attitude. \"Do I\\nunderstand that I am under restraint?\" he asked stiffly.\\n\\n\"Certainly not. Why should you be?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" returned the other contemplatively, \"it really might be regarded\\nas a subject for investigation. Of course I know only a small part of it.\\nBut there have certainly been suspicious circumstances. Piracy there has\\nbeen: no doubt of that. Murder, too, if my intuitions are not at fault. Or\\nat least, a disappearance to be accounted for. Robbery can\\'t be denied.\\nAnd there\\'s a dead body or two to be properly accredited.\" He looked the\\ncaptain in the eye.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll find my story highly unsatisfactory in detail, I fancy. I merely\\nwant to know whether I\\'m to present it as a defence, or only an\\nexplanation.\"\\n\\n\"We shall be glad to hear your story when you are ready to tell it--after\\nyou have seen Mr. Slade.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Darrow simply. \"You have heard his?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It needs filling in.\"\\n\\n\"When may I see him?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s for Dr. Trendon to say. He came to us almost dead. I\\'ll find out.\"\\n\\nThe surgeon reported Slade much better, but all a-quiver with excitement.\\n\\n\"Hate to put the strain on him,\" said he. \"But he\\'ll be in a fever till he\\ngets this thing off his mind. Send Mr. Darrow to him.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s consideration Darrow said: \"I should like to have you and\\nDr. Trendon present, Captain Parkinson, while I ask Eagen one or two\\nquestions.\"\\n\\n\"Understand one thing, Mr. Darrow,\" said Trendon briefly. \"This is not to\\nbe an inquisition.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Darrow, unmoved. \"I\\'m to be neither defendant nor prosecutor.\"\\n\\n\"You are to respect the condition of Dr. Trendon\\'s patient, sir,\" said\\nCaptain Parkinson, with emphasis. \"Outside of that, your attitude toward a\\nman who has twice thought of your life before his own is for you to\\ndetermine.\"\\n\\nNo little cynicism lurked in Darrow\\'s tones as he said:\\n\\n\"You have confidence in Mr. Slade, alias Eagen.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Captain Parkinson, in a tone that closed that topic.\\n\\n\"Still, I should be glad to have you gentlemen present, if only for a\\nmoment,\" insisted Darrow, presently.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would be as well--on account of the patient,\" said the surgeon\\nsignificantly.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" assented the captain.\\n\\nThe three went to Slade\\'s cabin. He was lying propped up in his bunk.\\nTrendon entered first, followed by the captain, then Darrow.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s your prize, Slade,\" said the surgeon.\\n\\nDarrow halted, just inside the door. With an eager light in his face Slade\\nleaned forward and stretched out his hand.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t believe it until I saw you, old man,\" he cried.\\n\\nDarrow\\'s eyebrows went up. Before Slade had time to note that there was no\\nresponse to his outstretched hand, the surgeon had jumped in and pushed\\nhim roughly back upon his pillow.\\n\\n\"What did you promise?\" he growled. \"You were to lie still, weren\\'t you?\\nAnd you\\'ll do it, or out we go.\"\\n\\n\"How are you, Eagen?\" drawled Darrow.\\n\\n\"Not Eagen. I\\'m done with that. They\\'ve told you, haven\\'t they?\"\\n\\nDarrow nodded. \"Are you the only survivor?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Except yourself.\"\\n\\n\"The Nigger? Pulz? Thrackles? The captain? All drowned?\"\\n\\n\"Not the captain. They murdered him.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Darrow softly. \"And you--I beg your pardon--your--er--friends\\ndisposed of the doctor in the same way?\"\\n\\n\"Handy Solomon,\" replied Slade with shaking lips. \"Hell\\'s got that fiend,\\nif there\\'s a hell for human fiends. They threw the doctor\\'s body in the\\nsurf.\"\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t notice whether there were any papers?\"\\n\\n\"If there were they must have been destroyed with the body when the lava\\npoured down the valley into the sea.\"\\n\\n\"The lava: of course,\" assented Darrow, with elaborate nonchalance. \"Well,\\nhe was a kind old boy. A cheerful, simple, wise old child.\"\\n\\n\"I would have given my right hand to save him,\" cried Slade. \"It was so\\nsudden--so damnable--\"\\n\\n\"Better to have saved him than me,\" said Darrow. He spoke with the first\\ntouch of feeling that he exhibited. \"I have to thank you for my life,\\nEagen--I beg your pardon: Slade. It\\'s hard to remember.\"\\n\\nDr. Trendon arose, and Captain Parkinson with him.\\n\\n\"Give you two hours, Mr. Darrow,\" said the surgeon. \"No more. If he seems\\nexhausted, give him one of these powders. I\\'ll look in in an hour.\"\\n\\nAt the end of an hour he returned. Slade was lying back on his pillow.\\nDarrow was talking, eagerly, confidentially. In another hour he came out.\\n\\n\"The whole thing is clear,\" he said to Captain Parkinson. \"I am ready to\\nreport to you.\"\\n\\n\"This evening,\" said the captain. \"The mess will want to hear.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they will want to hear,\" assented Darrow. \"You\\'ve had Slade\\'s story.\\nI\\'ll take it up where he left off, and he\\'ll check me. Mine\\'s as\\nincredible as--as Slade\\'s was. And it\\'s as true.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nTHE MAKER OF MARVELS\\n\\n\\nAs they had gathered to hear Ralph Slade\\'s tale, so now the depleted mess\\nof the _Wolverine_ grouped themselves for Percy Darrow\\'s sequel. Slade\\nhimself sat directly across from the doctor\\'s assistant. Before him lay a\\npaper covered with jotted notes. Trendon slouched low in the chair on\\nSlade\\'s right. Captain Parkinson had the other side. Convenient to\\nDarrow\\'s hand lay the material for cigarettes. As he talked he rolled\\ncylinder after cylinder, and between sentences consumed them in long,\\nsatisfying puffs.\\n\\n\"First you will want to learn of the fate of your friends and shipmates,\"\\nhe began. \"They are dead. One of them, Mr. Edwards, fell to my hands to\\nbury, as you know. He lies beside Handy Solomon. The others we shall\\nprobably not see: any one of a score of ocean currents may have swept them\\nfar away. The last great glow that you saw was the signal of their\\ndestruction. So the work of a great scientist, a potent benefactor of the\\nrace, a gentle and kindly old heart, has brought about the death of your\\nfriends and of my enemies. The innocent and the guilty ... the murderer\\nwith his plunder, the officer following his duty ... one and the same\\nend ... a paltry thing our vaunted science is in the face of such tangled\\nfates.\" He spoke low and bitterly. Then he squared his shoulders and his\\nmanner became businesslike.\\n\\n\"Interrupt me when any point needs clearing up,\" he said. \"It\\'s a blind\\ntrail at best. You\\'ve the right to see it as plain as I can make it--with\\nSlade\\'s help. Cut right in with your questions: There\\'ll be plenty to\\nanswer and some never will be answered....\\n\\n\"Now let me get this thing laid out clearly in my own mind. You first saw\\nthe glow--let me see--\"\\n\\n\"Night of June 2d,\" said Barnett.\\n\\n\"June 2d,\" agreed Darrow. \"That was the end of Solomon, Thrackles & Co. A\\nvery surprising end to them, if they had time to think,\" he added grimly.\\n\\n\"Surprising enough, from the survivor\\'s viewpoint,\" said Slade.\\n\\n\"Doubtless. They\\'ve had that story from you; I needn\\'t go over it. This\\nship picked up the _Laughing Lass_, deserted, and put your first crew\\naboard. That night, was it not, you saw the second pillar of fire?\"\\n\\nBarnett nodded.\\n\\n\"So your men met their death. Then came the second finding of the empty\\nschooner.... Captain Parkinson, they must have been brave men who faced\\nthe unknown terrors of that prodigy.\"\\n\\n\"They volunteered, sir,\" said the Captain, with simple pride.\\n\\nDarrow bowed with a suggestion of reverence in the slow movement of his\\nhead. \"And that night--or was it two nights later?--you saw the last\\nappearance of the portent. Well, I shall come to that.... Slade has told\\nyou how they lived on the beach. With us in the valley it was different.\\nAlmost from the first I was alone. The doctor ceased to be a companion. He\\nceased to be human, almost. A machine, that\\'s what he was. His one human\\ninstinct was--well, distrust. His whole force of being was centred on his\\ndiscovery. It was to make him the foremost scientist of the world; the\\nforemost individual entity of his time--of all time, possibly. Even to\\noutline it to you would take too much time. Light, heat, motive power in\\nincredible degrees and under such control as has never been known: these\\nwere to be the agencies at his call. The push of a button, the turn of a\\nscrew--oh, he was to be master of such power as no monarch ever wielded!\\nRiches--pshaw! Riches were the least of it. He could create them,\\npractically. But they would be superfluous. Power: unlimited, absolute\\npower was his goal. With his end achieved he could establish an autocracy,\\na dynasty of science: whatever he chose. Oh, it was a rich-hued, golden,\\nglowing dream; a dream such as men\\'s souls don\\'t formulate in these stale\\ndays--not our kind of men. The Teutonic mysticism--you understand. And it\\nwas all true. Oh, quite.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean us to understand that he had this power you describe?\" asked\\nCaptain Parkinson.\\n\\n\"In his grasp. Then comes a practical gentleman with a steel hook. A\\nfollower of dreams, too, in his way. Conflicting interests--you know how\\nit is. One well-aimed blow from the more practical dreamer, and the\\ngreater vision passes.... I\\'m getting ahead of myself. Just a moment.\"\\n\\nHis cigarette glowed fiercely in the dimness before he took up his tale\\nagain.\\n\\n\"You all know who Dr. Schermerhorn was. None of you know--I don\\'t know\\nmyself, though I\\'ve been his factotum for ten years--along how many varied\\nlines of activity that mind played. One of them was the secret of energy:\\nconcentrated, resistless energy. Man\\'s contrivances were too puny for him.\\nThe most powerful engines he regarded as toys. For a time high explosives\\nclaimed his attention. He wanted to harness them. Once he got to the point\\nof practical experiment. You can see the ruins yet: a hole in southern New\\nJersey. Nobody ever understood how he escaped. But there he was on his\\nfeet across a ten-foot fence in a ploughed field--yes, he flew the fence--\\nand running, running furiously in the opposite direction, when the dust\\ncleared away. Someone stopped him finally. Told him the danger was over.\\n\\'Yet, I will not return,\\' he said firmly, and fainted away. That disgusted\\nhim with high explosives. What secrets he discovered he gave to the\\ngovernment. They were not without value, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"They were not, indeed,\" corroborated Barnett.\\n\\n\"Next his interest turned to the natural phenomena of high energy. He\\nstudied lightning in an open steel network laboratory, with few results\\nsave a succession of rheumatic attacks, and an improved electric\\ninterrupter, since adopted by one of the great telegraph companies. The\\nformer obliged him to stop these experiments, and the invention he\\nconsidered trivial. Probably the great problem of getting at the secret of\\nenergy led him into his attempts to study the mysterious electrical waves\\nradiated by lightning flashes; at any rate he was soon as deep into the\\nsubject of electrical science as his countryman, Hertz, had ever been. He\\nused to tell me that he often wondered why he hadn\\'t taken up this line\\nbefore--the world of energy he now set out to explore, waves in that\\ntremendous range between those we hear and those we see. It was natural\\nthat he should then come to the most prominent radio-active elements,\\nuranium, thorium, and radium. But though his knowledge surpassed that of\\nthe much-exploited authorities, he was never satisfied with any of his\\nresults.\\n\\n\"\\'Pitchblende; no!\\' he would exclaim. \\'It has not the great power. The\\nmines are not deep enough, yet!\\'\\n\\n\"Then suddenly the great idea that was to bring him success, and cost him\\nhis life, came to him. The bowels of the earth must hold the secret! He\\ntook up volcanoes.... Does all this sound foolish? It was not if you knew\\nthe man. He was a mighty enthusiast, a born martyr. Not cold-blooded, like\\nthe rest of us. The fire was in his veins.... A light, please. Thank you.\\n\\n\"We chased volcanoes. There was a theory under it all. He believed that\\nvolcanic emanations are caused by a mighty and uncomprehended energy,\\nsomething that achieves results ascribable neither to explosions nor heat,\\nsome eternal, inner source.... Radium, if you choose, only he didn\\'t call\\nit that. Radium itself, as known to our modern scientists, he regarded as\\nthe harmless plaything of people with time hanging heavy on their hands.\\nHe wasn\\'t after force in pin-point quantities: he wanted bulk results. Yet\\nI believe that, after all, what he sought was a sort of higher power of\\nradium. The phenomena were related. And he had some of that concentrated\\nessence of pitchblende in the chest when we started. Oh, not much: say\\nabout twenty thousand dollars\\' worth. Maybe thirty. For use? No; rather\\nfor comparison, I judge.\\n\\n\"Yes, we chased volcanoes. I became used to camping between sample hells\\nof all known varieties. I got so that the fumes of a sulphur match seemed\\nlike a draught of pure, fresh air. Wherever any of the earth\\'s pimples\\nshowed signs of coming to a head, there were we, taking part in the\\ntrouble. By and by the doctor got so thoroughly poisoned that he had to\\nlay off. Back to Philadelphia we came. There an aged seafaring person,\\ntemporarily stranded, mulcted the Professor of a dollar--an undertaking\\nthat required no art--and in the course of his recital touched upon yonder\\nlittle cesspool of infernal iniquities. An uncharted volcanic island: one\\nthat he could have all for his own; you may guess whether Dr. Schermerhorn\\nwas interested.\\n\\n\"\\'That iss for which we haf so-long-in-vain sought, Percy,\\' he said to me\\nin his quaint, link-chain style of speech. \\'A leedle prifate volcano-\\nlaboratory to ourselves to have. Totally unknown: undescribed, not-on-the-\\nchart-to-be-found. To-morrow we start. I make a list of the things-to-\\nget.\\'\\n\\n\"He began his list, as I remember, with three dozen undershirts, a gallon\\nof pennyroyal for insect bites, a box of assorted fish hooks, thirty\\npounds of tea, and a case of carpet tacks. When I hadn\\'t anything else to\\nworry over, I used to lie awake at night and speculate on the purpose of\\nthose carpet tacks. He had something in mind: if there was anything on\\nwhich he prided himself, it was his practical bent. But the list never got\\nany further: it ceased short of one page in the ledger, as you may have\\nnoticed. I outfitted by telegraph on the way across the continent.\\n\\n\"The doctor didn\\'t ask me whether I\\'d go. He took it for granted. That\\'s\\nprobably why I didn\\'t back out. Nor did I tell him that the three life\\ninsurance companies which had foolishly and trustingly accepted me as a\\nrisk merely on the strength of a good constitution were making frantic\\nefforts to compromise on the policies. They felt hurt, those companies: my\\nhealthy condition had ceased to appeal to them. What\\'s a good constitution\\nbetween earthquakes? No, there was no use telling the doctor. It would\\nonly have worried him. Besides, I didn\\'t believe that the island was\\nthere. I thought it was a myth of that stranded ancient mariner\\'s\\nimagination. When it rose to sight at the proper spot, none were more\\nastounded than the bad risk who now addresses you.\\n\\n\"Yet, I must say for the island that it came handsomely up to\\nspecifications. Down where you were, Slade. you didn\\'t get a real insight\\ninto its disposition. But in back of us there was any kind of action for\\nyour money. Geysers, hell-spouts, fuming fissures, cunning little\\ncraterlets with half-portions of molten lava ready to serve hot; more\\ngases than you could create in all the world\\'s chemical laboratories: in\\nfact, everything to make the place a paradise for Old Nick--and Dr.\\nSchermerhorn. He brought along in his precious chest, besides the radium,\\nsome sort of raw material: also, as near as I could make out, a sort of\\ncage or guardianship scheme for his concentrated essence of cussedness,\\nwhen he should get it out of the volcano.\\n\\n\"In the first seven months he puttered around the little fumers, with an\\noccasional excursion up to the main crater. It was my duty to follow on\\nand drag him away when he fell unconscious. Sometimes I would try to get\\nhim before he was quite gone. Then he would become indignant, and fight\\nme. Perhaps that helped to lose me his confidence. More and more he\\nwithdrew into himself. There were days when he spoke no word to me. It was\\nlonely. Do you know why I used to visit you at the beach, Slade? I suppose\\nyou thought I was keeping watch on you. It wasn\\'t that, it was loneliness.\\nIn a way, it hurt me, too: for one couldn\\'t help but be fond of the old\\nboy; and at times it seemed as if he weren\\'t quite himself. Pardon me, if\\nI may trouble you for the matches? Thanks....\\n\\n\"Matters went very wrong at times: the doctor fumed like his little\\ncraters; growled out long-winded, exhaustive German imprecations: wouldn\\'t\\neven eat. Then again the demon of work would drive him with thong and\\nspur: he would rush to his craters, to his laboratories, to his ledger for\\nthe purpose of entering unintelligible commentaries. He had some peculiar\\ncontrivance, like a misshapen retort, with which he collected gases from\\nthe craterlets. Whenever I\\'d hear one of those smash, I knew it was a bad\\nday.\\n\\n\"Meantime, the volcano also became--well, what you might call\\ntemperamental.\\n\\n\"It got to be a year and a quarter--a year and a half. I wondered whether\\nwe should ever get away. My tobacco was running short. And the bearing of\\nthe men was becoming fidgetty. My visits to the beach became quite\\ninteresting--to me. One day the doctor came running out of his laboratory\\nwith so bright a face that I ventured to ask him about departure.\\n\\n\"\\'Not so long, now, Percy,\\' he said, in his old, kind manner. \\'Not so\\nlong. The first real success. It iss made. We have yet under-entire-\\ncontrol to bring it, but it iss made.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'And about time, sir,\\' said I. \\'If we don\\'t do something soon we may have\\ntrouble with the men.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'So?\\' said he in surprise. \\'But they could do nothing. Nothing.\\' He\\nwagged his great head confidently. \\'We are armed.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, yes, armed. So are they.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'We are armed,\\' he repeated obstinately. \\'Such as no man was ever armed,\\nare we armed.\\'\\n\\n\"He checked himself abruptly and walked away. Well, I\\'ve since wondered\\nwhat would have happened had the men attacked us. It would have been worth\\nseeing, and--and surprising. Yes: I\\'m quite certain it would have been\\nsurprising. Perhaps, too, I might have learned more of the Great\\nSecret ... and yet, I don\\'t know. It\\'s all dark ... a hint\\nhere ... theory ... mere glints of light.... Where did I put.... Ah,\\nthank you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nTHE ACHIEVEMENT\\n\\n\\nFor some moments Darrow sat gazing fixedly at the table before him. His\\ncigarette tip glowed and failed. Someone suggested drinks. The captain\\nasked Darrow what he would have, but the question went unnoted.\\n\\n\"How I passed the next six months I could hardly tell you,\" he began\\nagain, quite abruptly. \"At times I was bored--fearfully bored. Yet the\\nelement of mystery, of uncertainty, of underlying peril, gave a certain\\nzest to the affair. In the periods of dulness I found some amusement in\\nvisiting the lower camp and baiting the Nigger. Slade will have told you\\nabout him; he possessed quite a fund of bastard Voodooism: he possessed\\nmore before I got through with him. Yes; if he had lived to return to his\\ncountry, I fancy he would have added considerably to Afro-American witch-\\nlore. You remember the vampire bats, Slade? And the devil-fires? Naturally\\nI didn\\'t mention to you that the devil-fire business wasn\\'t altogether as\\nclear to me as I pretended. It wasn\\'t, though. But at the time it served\\nvery well as an amusement. All the while I realised that my self-\\nentertainment was not without its element of danger, too: I remember\\nglances not altogether friendly but always a little doubtful, a little\\nawed. Even Handy Solomon, practical as he was, had a scruple or two of\\nsuperstition in his make-up, on which one might work. Only Eagen--Slade, I\\nmean--was beyond me there. You puzzled me not a little in those days,\\nSlade. Well....\\n\\n\"Did I say that I was sometimes annoyed by the doctor\\'s attitude? Yes: it\\nseemed that he might have given me a little more of his confidence; but\\none can\\'t judge such a man as he was. Among the ordinary affairs of life\\nhe had relied on me for every detail. Now he was independent of me.\\nIndependent! I doubt if he remembered my existence at times. Even in his\\nblackest moods of depression he was sufficient unto himself. It was\\nstrange.... How he did rage the day the chemicals from Washington went\\nwrong! I was washing my shirt in the hot water spring when he came bolting\\nout of the laboratory and keeled me over. I came out pretty indignant.\\nApologise? Not at all. He just sputtered. His nearest approach to\\ncoherence seemed to indicate a desire that I should go back to Washington\\nat once and destroy a perfectly reputable firm of chemists. Finally he\\ncalmed down and took it out in entering it in his daily record. He was\\nquite proud of that daily record and remembered to write in it on an\\naverage of once a week.\\n\\n\"Then the chest went wrong. Whether it had rusted a bit, or whether the\\nchemicals had got in their work on the hinges, I don\\'t know; but one day\\nthe Professor, of his own initiative, recognised my existence by lugging\\nhis box out in the open and asking me to fix it. Previously he had emptied\\nit. It was rather a complicated thing, with an inner compartment over\\nwhich was a hollow cover, opening along one rim. That, I conjectured, was\\ndesigned to hold some chemical compound or salt. There were many minor\\nopenings, too, each guarded by a similar hollow door. My business was with\\nthe heavy top cover.\\n\\n\"\\'It should shut and open softly, gently,\\' explained the Professor. \\'So.\\nNot with-a-grating-sound-to-be-accompanied,\\' he added, with his curious\\neffect of linked phraseology.\\n\\n\"Half a day\\'s work fixed it. The lid would stand open of itself until\\ntipped at a considerable angle, when it would fall and lock. Only on the\\nouter shell was there a lock: that one was a good bit of craftsmanship.\\n\\n\"\\'So, Percy, my boy,\\' said the doctor kindly. \\'That will with-sufficient-\\nsafety guard our treasure. When we obtain it, Percy. When it entirely-\\nfinished-and-completed shall be.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'And when will that be?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\"\\'God knows,\\' he said cheerfully. \\'It progresses.\\'\\n\\n\"Whenever I went strolling at night, he would produce his curious lights.\\nSometimes they were fairly startling. One fact I made out by accident,\\nlooking down from a high place. They did not project from the laboratory.\\nHe always worked in the open when the light was to be produced. Once the\\nexperiment took a serious turn. The lights had flickered and gone. Dr.\\nSchermerhorn had returned to his laboratory. I came up the arroyo as he\\nflung the door open and rushed out. He was a grotesque figure, clad in an\\nundershirt and a worn pair of trousers, fastened with an old bit of tarred\\nrope in lieu of his suspenders, which I had been repairing. About his\\nwaist flickered a sort of aura of radiance which was extinguished as he\\nflung himself headforemost into the cold spring. I hauled him out. He\\nseemed dazed. To my questions he replied only by mumblings, the burden of\\nwhich was:\\n\\n\"\\'I do not understand. It is a not-to-be-comprehended accident.\\' It\\nappears that he didn\\'t quite know why he had taken to the water. Or if he\\ndid, he didn\\'t want to tell.\\n\\n\"Next day he was as good as new. Just as silent as before, but it was a\\nsmiling, satisfied silence. So it went for weeks, for months, with the\\naccesses of depression and anger always rarer. Then came an afternoon\\nwhen, returning from a stalk after sheep, I heard strange and shocking\\nnoises from the laboratory. Strict as was the embargo which kept me\\noutside the door, I burst in, only to be seized in a suffocating grip. Of\\na sudden I realised that I was being embraced. The doctor flourished a\\nhand above my head and jigged with ponderous steps. The dismal noises\\ncontinued to emanate from his mouth. He was singing. I wish I could give\\nyou a notion of the amazement, the paralysing wonder with which.... No,\\nyou did not know Dr. Schermerhorn: you would not understand....\\n\\n\"We polkaed into the open. There he cast me loose. He stopped singing and\\nburst into a rhapsody of disjointed words. Mostly German, it was--a\\nwondrous jumble of the scientific and poetic. \\'Eureka\\' occurred at\\nintervals. Then he would leap in the air. It was weird, it was\\ndistressing. Crazy? Oh, quite. For the time, you understand. If any of us\\nshould suddenly become the most potent individual in the world, wouldn\\'t\\nhe be apt to lose balance temporarily? One must make allowances. There was\\nexcuse for the doctor. He had reached the goal.\\n\\n\"\\'Percy, you shall be rewarded,\\' he said. \\'You haf like-a-trump-card stuck\\nby me. You shall haf riches, gold, what you will. You are young; your\\nblood runs red. With such riches nothing is beyond you. You could the\\nancient-tombs-of-Egypt explore. It is open to you such collections-as-\\nhave-never-been-gathered to make. What shall it be? Scarabs? Missals?\\nPrehistoric implements? Amuse yourself, _mein kind_. We shall be able the-\\nbills-with-usurious-interest to pay. What will you haf?\\'\\n\\n\"I said I\\'d like a vacation, if convenient.\\n\\n\"\\'Presently,\\' he replied. \\'There yet remains the guardianship to be\\nperfected. Then to-a-world-astonished-and-respectful we return. To-night\\nwe celebrate. I play you a rubber of pinochle.\\'\\n\\n\"We played. With the greatest secret of science resting at our elbows, we\\nplayed. The doctor won; my mind was not strictly on the game. In the\\nmorning the doctor sang once more.... I shall never hear its like again.\\nWas it a week, or a month, after that?... I cannot remember. I fancy I was\\nexcited. Then, too, there was something in the atmosphere about the\\nlaboratory ... I don\\'t know; imagination, possibly. Once we had a little\\nmanifestation: the night that the Nigger and Slade were terrified by the\\nrock fires. Days of excitement and pleasant work, with the little volcano\\ngrumbling more sulkily all the time ... I have spent worse days.\\n\\n\"Such indifference as the doctor displayed toward the volcano I have never\\nknown. If I ventured to warn him he would assure me that there was no\\ncause for alarm. I think he regarded that little hell\\'s kitchen as merely\\na feed-spout for his vast enterprise. He felt a sort of affection toward\\nit; he was tolerant of its petty fits of temper. That he completed his\\nwork before the destruction came was sheer luck. Nothing else. The day\\nbefore the outburst he came to me with a tiny phial of complicated design.\\n\\n\"\\'Percy, I will at-a-reasonable-price sell this to you,\\' he said.\\n\\n\"\\'How much?\\' I inquired, responding to his playfulness.\\n\\n\"\\'A bargain,\\' he cried gaily. \\'Five millions dollars. No! Shall I upon-a-\\nneedy-friend hard-press? Never. One million. One little million dollars.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I haven\\'t that amount with me,\\' I began.\\n\\n\"\\'Of no account,\\' he declared airily. \\'Soon we shall haf many more times\\nas that. Gif me your C.O. D.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'My I. O. U.?\\' I inquired.\\n\\n\"\\'It makes no matter. See. I will gif it to you gratis.\\'\\n\\n\"He handed me the metal contrivance. It was closed.\\n\\n\"\\'Inside iss a little, such a very little. Not yet iss it arranged the\\nmotive-power to give-forth. One more change-to-be-made that shall require.\\nBut the other phenomena are all in this little half-grain comprised. Later\\nI shall tell you more. Take it. It iss without price.\\' He laid his hand on\\nmy shoulder. \\'Like the love of friends,\\' he said gently.\"\\n\\nFeeling in his upper waistcoat pocket, Darrow brought out a phial, so tiny\\nthat it rolled in the palm of his hand. He contemplated it, lost in\\nthought.\\n\\n\"Radium?\" queried Barnett, with the keen interest of the scientist.\\n\\n\"God knows what it is,\" said Darrow, rousing himself. \"Not the perfected\\nproduct; the doctor said that when he gave it to me. If I could remember\\none-tenth of what he told me that night! It is like a disordered dream, a\\nphantasmagoria of monstrous powers, lit up with an intolerable, almost an\\ninfernal radiance. This much I did gather: that Dr. Schermerhorn had\\nachieved what the greatest minds before him had barely outlined. Yes, and\\nmore. Becquerel, the Curies, Rutherford--they were playing with the\\nletters of the Greek alphabet, Alphas, Gammas, and Rhos, while the simple,\\ngentle old boy that I served had read the secret. From the molten\\neruptions of the racked earth he had taken gases and potencies that are\\nnameless. By what methods of combination and refining I do not know, he\\nproduced something that was to be the final word of power. Control--\\ncontrol--that was all that lacked.\\n\\n\"Reduced to its simplest terms, it meant this: the doctor had something as\\nmuch greater than radium as radium is greater than the pitchblende of\\nwhich a thousand tons are melted down to the one ounce of extract. And the\\nincredible energies of this he proposed to divide into departments of\\nactivity. One manifestation should be light, a light that would illuminate\\nthe world. Another was to make motive power so cheap that the work of the\\nworld could be done in an hour out of the day. Some idea he had of healing\\nproperties. Yes; he was to cure mankind. Or kill, kill as no man had ever\\nkilled, did he choose. The armies and navies of the powers would be at his\\nmercy. Magnetism was to be his slave. Aerial navigation, transmutation of\\nmetals, the screening of gravity--does this sound like delirium? Sometimes\\nI think it was.\\n\\n\"That night he turned over to me the key of the large chest and his\\nledger. The latter he bade me read. It was a complete jumble. You have\\nseen it.... We were up a good part of the night with our pet volcano. It\\nwas suffering from internal disturbances. \\'So,\\' the doctor would say\\nindulgently, when a particularly active rock came bounding down our way.\\n\\'Little play-antics-to-exhibit now that the work iss finished.\\'\\n\\n\"In the morning he insisted on my leaving him alone and going down to give\\nthe orders. I took the ledger, intending to send it aboard. It saved my\\nlife possibly: Solomon\\'s bullet deflected slightly, I think, in passing\\nthrough the heavy paper. Slade has told you about my flight. I ought to\\nhave gone straight up the arroyo.... Yet I could hardly have made it.... I\\ndid not see him again, the doctor. My last glimpse ... the old man--I\\nremember now how the grey had spread through his beard--he was growing\\nold--it had been ageing labour. He stood there at his laboratory door and\\nthe mountain spouted and thundered behind.\\n\\n\"\\'We will a name-to-suit-properly gif it,\\' he said, as I left him. \\'It\\nshall make us as the gods. We will call it celestium.\\'\\n\\n\"I left him there smiling. Smiling happily. The greatest force of his\\nage--if he had lived. Very wise, very simple--a kind old child. May I\\ntrouble you for a light? Thanks.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nTHE DOOM\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing remained but to search for his body. I was sure they had killed\\nhim and taken the chest. I had little expectation of finding him, dead or\\nalive. None after I saw the stream of lava pouring into the sea. One saves\\nhis own life by instinct, I suppose. There I was. I had to live. It did\\nnot matter much, but I continued to do it by various shifts. That last day\\non the headland the fumes nearly got me. You may have noted the rather\\nexcited scrawl in the back of the ledger? Yes, I thought I was gone that\\ntime. But I got to the cave. It was low tide. Then the earthquake, and I\\nwas walled in.... Mr. Barnett\\'s very accurate explosives--Slade\\'s\\ninsistence--your risking your lives as you did, mites on the crust of a\\nred-hot cheese--I hope you know how I feel about it all. One can\\'t thank a\\nman properly for the life....\\n\\n\"Oh, the pirates. Necessarily it must be a matter of theory, but I think\\nwe have it right. Slade and I built it up. For what it\\'s worth, here it\\nis. Let me see: you sighted the glow on the night of the 2d. Next day came\\nthe deserted ship. It must have puzzled you outrageously.\"\\n\\n\"It did,\" said Captain Parkinson, drily.\\n\\n\"Not an easy problem, even with all the data at hand. You, of course, had\\nnone. On Slade\\'s showing, Handy Solomon and his worthy associates thought\\nthey had a chest full of riches when they got the doctor\\'s treasure;\\nbelieved they owned the machinery for making diamonds or gold or what-not\\nof ready-to-hand wealth. It\\'s fair to assume a certain eagerness on their\\npart. Disturbed weather keeps them busy until they\\'re well out from the\\nisland. Then to the chest. Opening it isn\\'t so easy: I had the key, you\\nknow.\" He brought a curious and delicately wrought skeleton from his\\npocket. \"Tipped with platinum,\" he observed. \"Rather a gem of a key, I\\nthink. You see, there must have been some action, even through the\\nkeyhole, or he wouldn\\'t have used a metal of this kind. But the crew was\\nrich in certain qualities, it seems, which I failed, stupidly, to\\nrecognise in my acquaintance with them. Both Pulz and Perdosa appear to\\nhave been handy men where locks were concerned. First Pulz sneaks down and\\nhas his turn at the chest. He gets it open. Small profit for him in that:\\nthe next we know of him he is scandalising Handy Solomon by having a fit\\non the deck.\"\\n\\n\"That is what I couldn\\'t figure out to save my life,\" said Slade eagerly.\\n\\n\"If you recollect, I told you of the Professor\\'s plunge in the cold\\nspring, in a sort of paroxysm, one day,\" said Darrow. \"That was the\\nphysiological action of the celestium. At other times, I have seen him\\ncome out and deliberately roll in the creek, head under. Once he explained\\nthat the medium he worked in caused a kind of uncontrollable longing for\\nwater; something having none of the qualities of burning or thirst, but an\\nirresistible temporary mania. It worried him a good deal; he didn\\'t\\nunderstand it. That, then, was what ailed Pulz. When he opened the chest\\nthere was, as I surmise, a trifling quantity of this stuff lying in the\\ninner lid. It wasn\\'t the celestium itself, as I imagine, but a sort of by-\\nproduct with the physiological and radiant effects of the real thing, and\\nit had been set there on guard, a discouragement to the spirit of\\ninvestigation, as it were. So, when the top was lifted, our little\\nguardian gets in its work, producing the light phenomenon that so puzzled\\nSlade, and inspiring Pulz with a passion for the rolling wave, which is\\nonly interrupted by Handy Solomon\\'s tackling him. As he fled he must have\\npulled down the cover.\"\\n\\n\"He did,\" said Slade. \"I heard the clang. But I saw the radiance on the\\nclouds. And the whole thickness of a solid oak deck was in between the sky\\nand the chest.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a little thing like an oak deck wouldn\\'t interrupt the kind of rays\\nthe doctor used. He had his own method of screening, you understand.\\nHowever, this inconsiderable guardian affair must have used itself up,\\nwhich true celestium wouldn\\'t have done. So when Perdosa sets his genius\\nfor lock-picking to the task, the inner box, full of the genuine article,\\nhas no warning sign-post, so to speak. Everything\\'s peaceful until they\\nraise the compound-filled hollow layer of the inner cover, which serves to\\ninterrupt the action. Then comes the general exit and the superior\\nfireworks.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s when the rays ran through the ship,\" said Slade. \"It seemed to\\nfollow the deck-lines.\"\\n\\n\"The stuff had a strange affinity for tar,\" said Darrow. \"I told you of\\nthe circle of fire about Professor Schermerhorn\\'s waist the day he gave me\\nsuch a scare. That was the celestium working on the tarred rope he wore\\nfor a belt. It made a livid circle on his skin. Did I tell you of his\\nexperiments with pitch? It doesn\\'t matter. Where was I?\"\\n\\n\"At the place where we all jumped,\" said Slade.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. And you dove into the small boat, trying to reach the water.\"\\n\\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Barnett. \"If that was the exhibition of radiance we\\nsaw, it died out in a few minutes. How was that? Did they close the chest\\nbefore they ran?\"\\n\\n\"Probably not,\" replied Darrow. \"Slade spoke of Pulz taking to the maintop\\nand being shaken out by the sudden shock of a wave. That may have been a\\nvolcanic billow. Whatever it was, it undoubtedly heeled the ship\\nsufficiently to bring down both lids, which were rather delicately\\nbalanced.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, for Billy Edwards found the chest closed and locked,\" said Barnett.\\n\\n\"Of course; it was a spring lock. You sent Mr. Edwards and his men aboard.\\nNo such experts as Pulz or Perdosa were in your crew. Consequently it took\\nlonger to get the chest open. When at length the lid was raised, there was\\na repetition of the tragedy. Mr. Edwards and his men leaped. Probably they\\nwere paralysed almost before they struck the water. Your bos\\'n, whom Slade\\npicked up, was the only one who had time even to grab a life preserver\\nbefore the impulse toward water became irresistible. There was no element\\nof fright, you understand: no desertion of their post. They were dragged\\nas by the sweep of a tornado.\" Darrow spoke direct to Captain Parkinson.\\n\"If there is any feeling among you other than sorrow for their death, it\\nis unjust and unworthy.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Darrow,\" returned the captain quietly.\\n\\n\"We found the chest closed again when the empty ship came back,\" observed\\nBarnett.\\n\\n\"Being masterless, the schooner began to yaw,\" continued Darrow. \"The\\nfirst time she came about would have heeled her enough to shut the chest.\\nNow came the turn of your other men.\"\\n\\n\"Ives and McGuire,\" said the Captain, as Darrow paused.\\n\\n\"The glow came again that night, and the next day we picked up Slade,\"\\nsaid Barnett.\\n\\n\"You know what the glow meant for your companions,\" said Darrow.\\n\\n\"But the ship. The _Laughing Lass_, man. She\\'s vanished. No one has seen\\nher since.\"\\n\\n\"You are wrong there,\" said Darrow. \"I have seen her.\"\\n\\nIn a common impulse the little circle leaned to him.\\n\\n\"Yes, I have seen her. I wish I had not. Let me bring my story back to the\\ncave on the island. After the volcanic gases had driven me to the refuge,\\nI sat near the mouth of the cave looking out into the darkness. That was\\nthe night of the 7th, the night you saw the last glow. It was very dark,\\nexcept for occasional bursts of fire from the crater. Judge of my\\nincredulous amazement when, in an access of this illumination, I saw\\nplainly a schooner hardly a mile off shore, coming in under bare poles.\"\\n\\n\"Under bare poles?\" cried Slade.\\n\\n\"The halliards must have disintegrated from some slow action of the\\ncelestium. It could be destructive: terrifically destructive. You shall\\njudge. There was the schooner, naked as your hand. Possibly I might have\\nthought it a hallucination but for what came after. Darkness fell again. I\\nsupposed then that Handy Solomon\\'s crew were managing--or mismanaging--the\\n_Laughing Lass_ without the aid of their leader, whom I had satisfactorily\\nburied. I hoped they would come ashore on the rocks. Yes I was\\nvengeful ... then.\\n\\n\"Of a sudden there sprang from the darkness a ship of light. You have all\\nseen those great electric effects at expositions. Someone touches a\\nbutton ... you know. It was like that. Only that the piercingly brilliant\\njewelled wonder of a ship was set in the midst of a swirl of vari-coloured\\nradiance such as I can\\'t begin to describe. You saw it from a distance.\\nImagine what it was, coming close upon you that way--dead on, out of the\\nnight. A living glory, a living terror....\"\\n\\nHis voice sank. With a shaking hand he fumbled amid his cigarette papers.\\n\\n\"It came on. A human figure, glowing like a diamond ablaze, leaped out\\nfrom it; another shot down from the foremast. I don\\'t know how many I saw\\ngo. It was like a theatric effect, unreal, unconvincing, incredible. The\\nend fitted it.\"\\n\\nDarrow\\'s eye roved.

We\\'ll try it.\"\\n\\nFrom his pocket he took a curious small phial.\\n\\n\"Is that what Dr. Schermerhorn gave you?\" asked Slade.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Darrow. He set it carefully inside the little model and\\nslipped a lever. Slade quietly turned down the light.\\n\\nA faint glow shot up. It grew bright and eddied in lovely, variant\\ncolours. As if set to a powder train, it ran through the ship. The pale\\nfaces of the spectators shone ghastly in its radiance. From someone burst\\na sudden gasp.\\n\\n\"There is not enough for danger,\" said Darrow, quietly.\\n\\n\"As a point of interest,\" grunted Trendon.\\n\\nEveryone looked at his outstretched hand. A little pocket compass lay in\\nthe palm. The needle spun madly, projecting blue, vivid sparklings.\\n\\n\"My God!\" cried Slade, and covered his eyes for a moment.\\n\\nHe snatched away his hands as a suppressed cry went up from the others.\\n\\n\"As I expected,\" said Darrow quietly.\\n\\nThe little craft opened out; it disintegrated. All that radiance dissolved\\nand with its going the substance upon which it shaped itself vanished. The\\nlast glow showed a formless pulp, spreading upon the water.\\n\\n\"So passed the _Laughing Lass_,\" said Darrow solemnly.\\n\\n\"And the chest is at the bottom of the sea,\" said Barnett.\\n\\n\"Good place for it,\" muttered Trendon.\\n\\n\"In all probability it closed as the ship dissolved around it,\" said\\nDarrow. \"Otherwise we should see the effects in the water.\"\\n\\n\"It might be recovered,\" cried Slade, excitedly.\\n\\n\"Could you chart it, Darrow? Think of the possibilities--\"\\n\\n\"Let it lie,\" said the captain. \"Has it not cost enough? Let it lie.\"\\n\\nThe water in the tub fumed and sparkled faintly and was still. Darkness\\nfell, except where Darrow\\'s cigarette point glowed and faded.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

              " 'When within a mile we put the helm up, and ran for the west end. A\\nbold point we avoided far out, lest there should be outlying ledges.\\nThen we came in sight of a broad beach and pounding surf.',\n",
              " 'I was ordered to take a surf boat and investigate for a landing and\\nan anchorage. The swell was running high. We rowed back and forth,\\npuzzled as to how to get ashore with all the freight it would be\\nnecessary to land. The ship would lie well enough, for the only open\\nexposure was broken by a long reef over which we could make out the\\nseas tumbling. But inshore the great waves rolled smoothly, swiftly--\\nthen suddenly fell forward as over a ledge, and spread with a roar\\nacross the yellow sands. The fresh winds blew the spume back to us.\\nWe conversed in shouts.',\n",

              " \"That was my opinion. We rowed slowly along, parallel to the shore,\\nand just outside the line of breakers. I don't know exactly how to\\ntell you the manner in which we became aware of the cove. It was as\\nnearly the instantaneous as can be imagined. One minute I looked ahead\\non a cliff as unbroken as the side of a cabin; the very next I peered\\ndown the length of a cove fifty fathoms long by about ten wide, at\\nthe end of which was a gravel beach. I cried out sharply to the men.\\nThey were quite as much astonished as I. We backed water, watching\\nclosely. At a given point the cove and all trace of its entrance\\ndisappeared. We could only just make out the line where the headlands\\ndissolved into the background of the cliffs, and that merely because\\nwe knew of its existence. The blending was perfect.\",\n",
              " \"We rowed in. The water was still. A faint ebb and flow whispered\\nagainst the tiny gravel beach at the end. I noted a practicable way\\nfrom it to the top of the cliff, and from the cliff down again to the\\nsand beach. Everything was perfect. The water was a beautiful light\\ngreen, like semi-opaque glass, and from the indistinctness of its\\ndepths waved and beckoned, rose and disappeared with indescribable\\ngrace and deliberation long feathery sea growths. In a moment the\\nbottom abruptly shallowed. The motion of the boat toward the beach\\npermitted us to catch a hasty glimpse of little fish darting, of big\\nfish turning, of yellow sand and some vivid colour. Then came the\\ngrate of gravel and the scraping of the boat's bottom on the beach.\\nWe jumped ashore eagerly. I left the men, very reluctant, and ascended\\na natural trail to a high sloping down over which blew the great Trades.\\nGrass sprung knee-high. A low hill rose at the back. From below the\\nfall of the cliff came the pounding of surf.\",\n",
              " 'I walked to the edge. Various ledges, sloping toward me, ran down to\\nthe sea. Against one of them was a wreck, not so very old, head on,\\nher afterworks gone. I recognised the name _Golden Horn_, and\\nwas vastly astonished to find her here against this unknown island.\\nFar up the coast I could see--with the surges dashing up like the explosion\\nof shells, and the cliffs, and the rampart of hills grown with grass\\nand cactus. A bold promontory terminated the coast view to the north,\\nand behind it I could glimpse a more fertile and wooded country. The\\nsky was partly overcast by the volcanic murk. It fled before the\\nTrades, and the red sun alternately blazed and clouded through it.',\n",
              " 'As there was nothing more to be seen here, I turned above the hollow\\nof our cove, skirted the base of the hill, and so down to the beach.',\n",
              " 'It occupied a wide semicircle where the hills drew back. The flat was\\ndry and grown with thick, coarse grass. A stream emerged from a sort\\nof canon on its landward side. I tasted it, found it sulphurous, and\\na trifle worse than lukewarm. A little nearer the cliff, however, was\\na clear, cold spring from the rock, and of this I had a satisfying\\ndrink. When I arose from my knees, I made out an animal on the hill\\ncrest looking at me, but before I could distinguish its\\ncharacteristics it had disappeared.',\n",
              " 'I returned along the tide sands. The surf dashed and roared, lifting\\nseaweeds of a blood red, so that in places the water looked pink.\\nSeals innumerable watched me from just outside the breakers. As the\\nwaves lifted to a semi-transparence, I could make out others playing,\\ndarting back and forth, up and down like disturbed tadpoles, clinging\\nto the wave until the very instant of its fall, then disappearing as\\nthough blotted out. The salt smell of seaweed was in my nostrils: I\\nfound the place pleasant--',\n",
              " 'With these few and scattered impressions we returned to the ship. It\\nhad been warped to a secure anchorage, and snugged down. Dr.\\nSchermerhorn and Darrow were on deck waiting to go ashore.',\n",
              " \"I made my report. The two passengers disappeared. They carried lunch\\nand would not be back until night-fall.

              " 'Our way proceeded across the grass flat, through the opening of the\\nnarrow cañon, and so on back into the interior by way of the bed\\nthrough which flowed the sulphur stream. The country was badly eroded.\\nMost of the time we marched between perpendicular clay banks about\\nforty feet high. These were occasionally broken by smaller tributary\\narroyos of the same sort. It would have been impossible to reach the\\nlevel of the upper country. The bed of the main arroyo was flat, and\\ngrown with grasses and herbage of an extraordinary vividness, due,\\nI supposed, to the sulphur water. The stream itself meandered aimlessly\\nthrough the broader bed. It steadily grew warmer and the sulphur smell\\nmore noticeable. Above us we could see the sky and the sharp clay edge\\nof the arroyo. I noticed the tracks of Darrow and Dr. Schermerhorn\\nmade the day before.',\n",
              " 'After a mile of this, the bottom ran up nearly to the level of the\\nsides, and we stepped out on the floor of a little valley almost\\nsurrounded by more hills.',\n",

The steam blew here and\\nthere among the pines on the floor; rose to eddy about the naked\\npainted hills. At one end we saw intermittently a broad ascending\\ncañon--deep red and blue-black--ending in the cone of a smoking\\nvolcano. The other seemed quite closed by the sheer hills; in fact\\nthe only exit was the route by which we had come.',\n",
              " 'For the hills were utterly precipitous. I suppose a man might have\\nmade his way up the various knobs, ledges, and inequalities, but it\\nwould have required long study and a careful head. I, myself, later\\nworked my way a short distance, merely to examine the texture of their\\nmarvellous colour.',\n",
              " \"This was at once varied and of great body--not at all like the smooth,\\nglossed colour of most rock, but soft and rich. You've seen painters'\\npalettes--it was just like that, pasty and _fat_. There were reds\\nof all shades, from a veritable scarlet to a red umber; greens, from\\nsea-green to emerald; several kinds of blue, and an indeterminate\\npurple-mauve. The whole effect was splendid and barbaric.\",\n",
              " 'We stopped and gasped as it hit our eyes. Darrow alone was unmoved.\\nHe led the way forward and in an instant had disappeared behind the\\nveil of steam. Thrackles and Perdosa hung back murmuring, but at a\\nsharp word from me gathered their courage in their two hands and proceeded.',\n",

Caught in the swirl, it rounded the cape, and I came down to the shore to meet it. Halfway down the cliff I had a better view. I saw it was not a tin can. There was a dark body under it, which the waves were tossing about, and as the metal moved with the body, it glinted in the sun. Suddenly it was borne in upon me that an arm was doing the signalling, waving to me with a sprightly, even a jocular friendliness. Then I saw what it really was. It was Handy Solomon and his steel hook. He was riding quite high. Every now and again he would bow and wave. He grounded gently on the sand beach. I planted him promptly. First, however, I removed a bag of tobacco from his pocket. Poor stuff, and water soaked, but still tobacco. Spent a quiet afternoon carving a headstone for the dear departed.

And why should one philosophise in a book that will never be read? Hold on! Perhaps--just perhaps--it may be read. The officer was not long dead. Ensigns of the U.

With us in the valley it was different. Almost from the first I was alone. The doctor ceased to be a companion. He ceased to be human, almost. A machine, that's what he was. His one human instinct was--well, distrust. His whole force of being was centred on his discovery. It was to make him the foremost scientist of the world; the foremost individual entity of his time--of all time, possibly. Even to outline it to you would take too much time. Light, heat, motive power in incredible degrees and under such control as has never been known: these were to be the agencies at his call. The push of a button, the turn of a screw--oh, he was to be master of such power as no monarch ever wielded! Riches--pshaw! Riches were the least of it. He could create them, practically. But they would be superfluous. Power: unlimited, absolute power was his goal. With his end achieved he could establish an autocracy, a dynasty of science: whatever he chose.

One of them was the secret of energy: concentrated, resistless energy. Man's contrivances were too puny for him. The most powerful engines he regarded as toys. For a time high explosives claimed his attention. He wanted to harness them. Once he got to the point of practical experiment. You can see the ruins yet: a hole in southern New Jersey. Nobody ever understood how he escaped. But there he was on his feet across a ten-foot fence in a ploughed field--yes, he flew the fence-- and running, running furiously in the opposite direction, when the dust cleared away. Someone stopped him finally. Told him the danger was over. 'Yet, I will not return,' he said firmly, and fainted away. That disgusted him with high explosives. What secrets he discovered he gave to the government. They were not without value, I believe.\",\n",
              "  'They were not, indeed,',\n",

He studied lightning in an open steel network laboratory, with few results save a succession of rheumatic attacks, and an improved electric interrupter, since adopted by one of the great telegraph companies. The former obliged him to stop these experiments, and the invention he considered trivial. Probably the great problem of getting at the secret of energy led him into his attempts to study the mysterious electrical waves radiated by lightning flashes; at any rate he was soon as deep into the subject of electrical science as his countryman, Hertz, had ever been. He used to tell me that he often wondered why he hadn't taken up this line before--the world of energy he now set out to explore, waves in that tremendous range between those we hear and those we see. It was natural that he should then come to the most prominent radio-active elements, uranium, thorium, and radium. But though his knowledge surpassed that of the much-exploited authorities, he was never satisfied with any of his results.\",\n",

              "  'Then suddenly the great idea that was to bring him success, and cost him his life, came to him. The bowels of the earth must hold the secret! He took up volcanoes.... Does all this sound foolish? It was not if you knew the man. He was a mighty enthusiast, a born martyr. Not cold-blooded, like the rest of us. The fire was in his veins.... A light, please. Thank you.',\n",
              "  \"We chased volcanoes. There was a theory under it all. He believed that volcanic emanations are caused by a mighty and uncomprehended energy, something that achieves results ascribable neither to explosions nor heat, some eternal, inner source.... Radium, if you choose, only he didn't call it that. Radium itself, as known to our modern scientists, he regarded as the harmless plaything of people with time hanging heavy on their hands. He wasn't after force in pin-point quantities: he wanted bulk results. Yet I believe that, after all, what he sought was a sort of higher power of radium. The phenomena were related. And he had some of that concentrated essence of pitchblende in the chest when we started. Oh, not much: say about twenty thousand dollars' worth. Maybe thirty. For use? No; rather for comparison, I judge.\",\n",
              "  \"Yes, we chased volcanoes. I became used to camping between sample hells of all known varieties. I got so that the fumes of a sulphur match seemed like a draught of pure, fresh air. Wherever any of the earth's pimples showed signs of coming to a head, there were we, taking part in the trouble. By and by the doctor got so thoroughly poisoned that he had to lay off. Back to Philadelphia we came. There an aged seafaring person, temporarily stranded, mulcted the Professor of a dollar--an undertaking that required no art--and in the course of his recital touched upon yonder little cesspool of infernal iniquities. An uncharted volcanic island: one that he could have all for his own; you may guess whether Dr. Schermerhorn was interested.\",\n",
              "  \"'That iss for which we haf so-long-in-vain sought, Percy,' he said to me in his quaint, link-chain style of speech. 'A leedle prifate volcano- laboratory to ourselves to have.

              "  \"He began his list, as I remember, with three dozen undershirts, a gallon of pennyroyal for insect bites, a box of assorted fish hooks, thirty pounds of tea, and a case of carpet tacks. When I hadn't anything else to worry over, I used to lie awake at night and speculate on the purpose of those carpet tacks. He had something in mind: if there was anything on which he prided himself, it was his practical bent. But the list never got any further: it ceased short of one page in the ledger, as you may have noticed. I outfitted by telegraph on the way across the continent.\",\n",
              "  \"The doctor didn't ask me whether I'd go. He took it for granted. That's probably why I didn't back out. Nor did I tell him that the three life insurance companies which had foolishly and trustingly accepted me as a risk merely on the strength of a good constitution were making frantic efforts to compromise on the policies. They felt hurt, those companies: my healthy condition had ceased to appeal to them. What's a good constitution between earthquakes? No, there was no use telling the doctor. It would only have worried him. Besides, I didn't believe that the island was there. I thought it was a myth of that stranded ancient mariner's imagination. When it rose to sight at the proper spot, none were more astounded than the bad risk who now addresses you.\",\n",
              "  \"Yet, I must say for the island that it came handsomely up to specifications. Down where you were, Slade. you didn't get a real insight into its disposition. But in back of us there was any kind of action for your money. Geysers, hell-spouts, fuming fissures, cunning little craterlets with half-portions of molten lava ready to serve hot; more gases than you could create in all the world's chemical laboratories: in fact, everything to make the place a paradise for Old Nick--and Dr. Schermerhorn. He brought along in his precious chest, besides the radium, some sort of raw material: also, as near as I could make out, a sort of cage or guardianship scheme for his concentrated essence of cussedness, when he should get it out of the volcano.\",\n",
              "  \"In the first seven months he puttered around the little fumers, with an occasional excursion up to the main crater. It was my duty to follow on and drag him away when he fell unconscious. Sometimes I would try to get him before he was quite gone. Then he would become indignant, and fight me. Perhaps that helped to lose me his confidence. More and more he withdrew into himself. There were days when he spoke no word to me. It was lonely. Do you know why I used to visit you at the beach, Slade? I suppose you thought I was keeping watch on you. It wasn't that, it was loneliness. In a way, it hurt me, too: for one couldn't help but be fond of the old boy; and at times it seemed as if he weren't quite himself. Pardon me, if I may trouble you for the matches? Thanks....\",\n",
              "  \"Matters went very wrong at times: the doctor fumed like his little craters; growled out long-winded, exhaustive German imprecations: wouldn't even eat. Then again the demon of work would drive him with thong and spur: he would rush to his craters, to his laboratories, to his ledger for the purpose of entering unintelligible commentaries. He had some peculiar contrivance, like a misshapen retort, with which he collected gases from the craterlets. Whenever I'd hear one of those smash, I knew it was a bad day.\",\n",

              " [\"How I passed the next six months I could hardly tell you. At times I was bored--fearfully bored. Yet the element of mystery, of uncertainty, of underlying peril, gave a certain zest to the affair. In the periods of dulness I found some amusement in visiting the lower camp and baiting the Nigger. Slade will have told you about him; he possessed quite a fund of bastard Voodooism: he possessed more before I got through with him. Yes; if he had lived to return to his country, I fancy he would have added considerably to Afro-American witch- lore. You remember the vampire bats, Slade? And the devil-fires? Naturally I didn't mention to you that the devil-fire business wasn't altogether as clear to me as I pretended. It wasn't, though. But at the time it served very well as an amusement. All the while I realised that my self- entertainment was not without its element of danger, too: I remember glances not altogether friendly but always a little doubtful, a little awed. Even Handy Solomon, practical as he was, had a scruple or two of superstition in his make-up, on which one might work. Only Eagen--Slade, I mean--was beyond me there. You puzzled me not a little in those days, Slade. Well....\",\n",

Yes: it seemed that he might have given me a little more of his confidence; but one can't judge such a man as he was. Among the ordinary affairs of life he had relied on me for every detail. Now he was independent of me. Independent! I doubt if he remembered my existence at times. Even in his blackest moods of depression he was sufficient unto himself. It was strange.... How he did rage the day the chemicals from Washington went wrong! I was washing my shirt in the hot water spring when he came bolting out of the laboratory and keeled me over. I came out pretty indignant. Apologise? Not at all. He just sputtered. His nearest approach to coherence seemed to indicate a desire that I should go back to Washington at once and destroy a perfectly reputable firm of chemists. Finally he calmed down and took it out in entering it in his daily record. He was quite proud of that daily record and remembered to write in it on an average of once a week.\",\n",
              "  \"Then the chest went wrong. Whether it had rusted a bit, or whether the chemicals had got in their work on the hinges, I don't know; but one day the Professor, of his own initiative, recognised my existence by lugging his box out in the open and asking me to fix it. Previously he had emptied it. It was rather a complicated thing, with an inner compartment over which was a hollow cover, opening along one rim. That, I conjectured, was designed to hold some chemical compound or salt. There were many minor openings, too, each guarded by a similar hollow door. My business was with the heavy top cover.\",\n",

Dr. Schermerhorn had returned to his laboratory. I came up the arroyo as he flung the door open and rushed out. He was a grotesque figure, clad in an undershirt and a worn pair of trousers, fastened with an old bit of tarred rope in lieu of his suspenders, which I had been repairing.

Strict as was the embargo which kept me outside the door, I burst in, only to be seized in a suffocating grip. Of a sudden I realised that I was being embraced. The doctor flourished a hand above my head and jigged with ponderous steps. The dismal noises continued to emanate from his mouth. He was singing.

This much I did gather: that Dr. Schermerhorn had achieved what the greatest minds before him had barely outlined. Yes, and more. Becquerel, the Curies, Rutherford--they were playing with the letters of the Greek alphabet, Alphas, Gammas, and Rhos, while the simple, gentle old boy that I served had read the secret. From the molten eruptions of the racked earth he had taken gases and potencies that are nameless.

Another was to make motive power so cheap that the work of the world could be done in an hour out of the day. Some idea he had of healing properties. Yes; he was to cure mankind. Or kill, kill as no man had ever killed, did he choose. The armies and navies of the powers would be at his mercy. Magnetism was to be his slave.

He stood there at his laboratory door and the mountain spouted and thundered behind.\",\n",
              "  \"'We will a name-to-suit-properly gif it,' he said, as I left him. 'It shall make us as the gods. We will call it celestium.'\",\n",

              " [\"Nothing remained but to search for his body. I was sure they had killed him and taken the chest. I had little expectation of finding him, dead or alive. None after I saw the stream of lava pouring into the sea. One saves his own life by instinct, I suppose. There I was. I had to live. It did not matter much, but I continued to do it by various shifts. That last day on the headland the fumes nearly got me. You may have noted the rather excited scrawl in the back of the ledger? Yes, I thought I was gone that time. But I got to the cave. It was low tide. Then the earthquake, and I was walled in.... Mr. Barnett's very accurate explosives--Slade's insistence--your risking your lives as you did, mites on the crust of a red-hot cheese--I hope you know how I feel about it all. One can't thank a man properly for the life....\",\n",
              "  \"Oh, the pirates. Necessarily it must be a matter of theory, but I think we have it right. Slade and I built it up. For what it's worth, here it is. Let me see: you sighted the glow on the night of the 2d. Next day came the deserted ship. It must have puzzled you outrageously.\",\n",
              "  'It did,',\n",
              "  \"Not an easy problem, even with all the data at hand. You, of course, had none. On Slade's showing, Handy Solomon and his worthy associates thought they had a chest full of riches when they got the doctor's treasure; believed they owned the machinery for making diamonds or gold or what-not of ready-to-hand wealth. It's fair to assume a certain eagerness on their part. Disturbed weather keeps them busy until they're well out from the island. Then to the chest. Opening it isn't so easy: I had the key, you know.. Tipped with platinum. Rather a gem of a key, I think. You see, there must have been some action, even through the keyhole, or he wouldn't have used a metal of this kind. But the crew was rich in certain qualities, it seems, which I failed, stupidly, to recognise in my acquaintance with them. Both Pulz and Perdosa appear to have been handy men where locks were concerned. First Pulz sneaks down and has his turn at the chest. He gets it open. Small profit for him in that: the next we know of him he is scandalising Handy Solomon by having a fit on the deck.\",\n",
              "  \"That is what I couldn't figure out to save my life,\",\n",
              "  \"If you recollect, I told you of the Professor's plunge in the cold spring, in a sort of paroxysm, one day. That was the physiological action of the celestium. At other times, I have seen him come out and deliberately roll in the creek, head under. Once he explained that the medium he worked in caused a kind of uncontrollable longing for water; something having none of the qualities of burning or thirst, but an irresistible temporary mania. It worried him a good deal; he didn't understand it. That, then, was what ailed Pulz. When he opened the chest there was, as I surmise, a trifling quantity of this stuff lying in the inner lid. It wasn't the celestium itself, as I imagine, but a sort of by- product with the physiological and radiant effects of the real thing, and it had been set there on guard, a discouragement to the spirit of investigation, as it were. So, when the top was lifted, our little guardian gets in its work, producing the light phenomenon that so puzzled Slade, and inspiring Pulz with a passion for the rolling wave, which is only interrupted by Handy Solomon's tackling him. As he fled he must have pulled down the cover.\",\n",
              "  'He did. I heard the clang. But I saw the radiance on the clouds. And the whole thickness of a solid oak deck was in between the sky and the chest.',\n",
              "  \"Oh, a little thing like an oak deck wouldn't interrupt the kind of rays the doctor used. He had his own method of screening, you understand. However, this inconsiderable guardian affair must have used itself up, which true celestium wouldn't have done. So when Perdosa sets his genius for lock-picking to the task, the inner box, full of the genuine article, has no warning sign-post, so to speak. Everything's peaceful until they raise the compound-filled hollow layer of the inner cover, which serves to interrupt the action. Then comes the general exit and the superior fireworks.\",\n",
              "  \"That's when the rays ran through the ship. It seemed to follow the deck-lines.\",\n",
              "  \"The stuff had a strange affinity for tar. I told you of the circle of fire about Professor Schermerhorn's waist the day he gave me such a scare. That was the celestium working on the tarred rope he wore for a belt. It made a livid circle on his skin. Did I tell you of his experiments with pitch? It doesn't matter. Where was I?\",\n",
              "  'At the place where we all jumped,',\n",
              "  'Oh, yes. And you dove into the small boat, trying to reach the water.',\n",
              "  'Wait a bit. If that was the exhibition of radiance we saw, it died out in a few minutes. How was that? Did they close the chest before they ran?',\n",
              "  'Probably not. Slade spoke of Pulz taking to the maintop and being shaken out by the sudden shock of a wave. That may have been a volcanic billow. Whatever it was, it undoubtedly heeled the ship sufficiently to bring down both lids, which were rather delicately balanced.',\n",
              "  'Yes, for Billy Edwards found the chest closed and locked,',\n",
              "  \"Of course; it was a spring lock. You sent Mr. Edwards and his men aboard. No such experts as Pulz or Perdosa were in your crew. Consequently it took longer to get the chest open. When at length the lid was raised, there was a repetition of the tragedy. Mr. Edwards and his men leaped. Probably they were paralysed almost before they struck the water. Your bos'n, whom Slade picked up, was the only one who had time even to grab a life preserver before the impulse toward water became irresistible. There was no element of fright, you understand: no desertion of their post. They were dragged as by the sweep of a tornado.. If there is any feeling among you other than sorrow for their death, it is unjust and unworthy.\",\n",
              "  'Thank you, Mr. Darrow,',\n",
              "  'We found the chest closed again when the empty ship came back,',\n",
              "  'Being masterless, the schooner began to yaw. The first time she came about would have heeled her enough to shut the chest. Now came the turn of your other men.',\n",

              "  'The glow came again that night, and the next day we picked up Slade,',\n",

After the volcanic gases had driven me to the refuge, I sat near the mouth of the cave looking out into the darkness. That was the night of the 7th, the night you saw the last glow. It was very dark, except for occasional bursts of fire from the crater. Judge of my incredulous amazement when, in an access of this illumination, I saw plainly a schooner hardly a mile off shore, coming in under bare poles.',\n",
              "  'Under bare poles?',\n",
              "  \"The halliards must have disintegrated from some slow action of the celestium. It could be destructive: terrifically destructive. You shall judge. There was the schooner, naked as your hand. Possibly I might have thought it a hallucination but for what came after. Darkness fell again. I supposed then that Handy Solomon's crew were managing--or mismanaging--the _Laughing Lass_ without the aid of their leader, whom I had satisfactorily buried. I hoped they would come ashore on the rocks. Yes I was vengeful ... then.\",\n",
              "  \"Of a sudden there sprang from the darkness a ship of light. You have all seen those great electric effects at expositions. Someone touches a button ... you know. It was like that. Only that the piercingly brilliant jewelled wonder of a ship was set in the midst of a swirl of vari-coloured radiance such as I can't begin to describe. You saw it from a distance.
